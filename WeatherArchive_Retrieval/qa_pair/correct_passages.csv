"THE LM CROP, Eau Claire, Wis, March 30 A heavy rainstorm, which set in early Saturday morning, followed by moderate weather, has virtually suspended logging operations in the Chippewa Valley, and the camps, with few exceptions, have broken up, after having accomplished a good season's work. The rains have caused a rise of nearly two feet in the Chippewa and Eau, which is perceptible at this point, and there is a prospect of the ice moving out of the Dells reservoir and other dams above before the close of the week, leaving the river free for a resumption of raft and boat navigation. The improvement at the mills are about completed, and there is a possibility that several of the establishments having a surplus of logs from last season will commence operations this week. A large number of men were sent up both rivers this morning, so as to be in readiness for the drive, which is anticipated to take place earlier than usual. ON THE WOLF AND WAUPACA RIVERS, Waupaca, Wisconsin, March 30 The lumbermen, with their teams, are rushing out of the woods and spending a few days in the cities preparatory to going on to the river. The rivers are all open now, but the dams are frozen to such an extent that logs cannot be run through. On the Wolf, Little Wolf and Waupaca rivers are large crops of logs, and the present season will be a good one for rivermen. The Wisconsin Central Railway is running extra log trains daily, and there is said to be logs enough on their line north of Stevens Point to furnish business for the road all summer. The Weed & Gumaer Manufacturing Company of Weyauwega buys logs from one hundred miles north, saws them at their mills at that place, and re-ships the dressed lumber back to Stevens Point, forty miles north of Weyauwega. There are several new sawmills being erected at the small towns on the railroad, and a lively business will be carried on this summer."
"Maury, """"must be visited with a thorough system of observations."""" NOT MUCH OF A STORM AFTER ALL ROCHESTER, March 10 The deciding games in the pool tournament were played tonight. Albert Frey took the first prize, John B. Suessinger the second, Samuel Knight the third, and George B. Sutton the fourth. Ottawa, March 11 The weather today has been cold, cloudy and gusty. Tonight the wind is higher than it has been all day, but there has been no approach to a storm, though snow fell to a considerable depth during Saturday night. Some excitement was created yesterday afternoon, when telegrams were received stating that severe gales and a tidal wave had occurred on the coast of Nova Scotia and the eastern coast of the United States, and, in consequence, Wiggins' stock went up, but it had a downward tendency tonight. Mr. Wiggins claims Saturday's snowstorm as part of his great blow. IN THE EASTERN TOWNSHIPS AN EARTHQUAKE Waterville, Que., March 11 The severest storm known for years is in progress today."
"Wiggins claims Saturday's snowstorm as part of his great blow. IN THE EASTERN TOWNSHIPS AN EARTHQUAKE Waterville, Que., March 11 The severest storm known for years is in progress today. Snow began falling yesterday afternoon, and continued unabated through the night. The wind has been blowing a gale all day, and the snow is piled almost mountains high, making traffic of all kinds absolutely impossible. It will take some days to clear the snow blockade, so that business may resume its normal condition. The mayor is engaging a large force of men to open the streets. Between 10 and 11 o'clock two distinct shocks of earthquake were felt, the wave passing from east to west, and causing great alarm. The country roads will be impassable for days. The mails between here and Magog are to be carried by team, trains being cancelled. In the meantime, the Central Vermont and South Eastern railways are making almost superhuman efforts to get their lines open. Wiggins was regarded as rank on Saturday, and today he is looked upon as indeed a prophet of the prophets. St."
"A few minutes after 1 o'clock the storm-signal was up at the Citadel station, and people then began to prepare for a storm. Many still stuck to the belief that it would be only an ordinary March blow, but the majority began to doubt this, and made preparations for what they expected would soon turn out to be a fulfillment of Wiggins' warning. Steamers and sailing vessels in the docks were secured to their wharves with extra hawsers, and merchandise in places of insecurity was removed to higher and safer quarters. No remarkable change occurred throughout the following two hours, but about 4 o'clock the wind quickened, gaining strength, light short distance when the storm was at its height, between 8 and 9, but pulled up before getting into danger. The steamer Sarmatian, from Liverpool, and steamer Newfoundland, from St. John's, Nfld., which arrived this morning, report having felt the blow only lightly, and were caused no anxiety. The Gloucester fishing schooner Admiral, which put in today to land a sick man, had to lay-to during the gale, which struck her with great violence."
"The high tide has gone completely down and the vessels ride easily in their docks. The steamer Sardinian, for Liverpool with the weekly mail, still remains in port. The effects of last evening's storm, reports of the violence of which are now coming in from all parts of Nova Scotia, prove it to have been not so serious as was expected. At the south end of the city part of an old wharf on which the Howell tin-dry was situated was blown away, but the other wharves and property on the water line suffered only slightly. The damage to vessels in the harbor was quite bad, and the heaving up of a few planks in wharves makes up all the other damage yet reported. Vessels at anchor in the harbor rode out the gale without injury. The barometer fell to the highest point known here since the Saxby gale. At eight o'clock it was nearly on a level with the wharves and at nine, when at its highest, the sea washed over in many places, and barrels of flour, meal and other merchandise in exposed places were swept about, but no serious damage, it is thought, has resulted."
"ML COST $400,080 Several New Intercepting Sewers Proposed by Mr St George THE FLOODING OF CELLARS In Great Part Caused by Outside Municipalities-The City Surveyor had Reported This but no Action was Taken by the Council The City Surveyor has addressed the following important communication to the chairman and members of the Road committee on the flooding of cellars, and also on the necessity of constructing a new intercepting sewer on Sherbrooke and St James streets. It reads as follows: Gentlemen, I beg to attach you herewith a report of Mr Brittain, recommending the construction of a new intercepting sewer on Sherbrooke street from Beaudry street to Coteau Neiges road. The construction of this sewer has become necessary by the fact that the city is receiving so many claims for flooding through the overflowing of the Coteau Harron main sewer and the intercepting sewer during very heavy exceptional rain storms. In my opinion these claims should not be entertained for the following reasons: 1. The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then."
"The Coteau Harron main sewer was built in 1867 in a low swampy valley, when the street was not formed and consequently no houses could have existed then. The natural conclusion is that the houses must have been built since the sewer was constructed, and therefore, the city should not be held responsible. In regard to the intercepting sewer on St Catherine street, there is only one portion of it which is at present needed during heavy rainstorms, that is between St Lawrence and St George streets. These floodings take place only when there is an exceptionally heavy rainstorm, but these floodings would not have occurred if Westmount municipality, who had the permission of the city to drain their drainage into the intercepting sewer, had abided by the plan which they submitted to the city."
"I have repeatedly notified the city of their action and have asked the city to allow me to dam the end of our sewer so as to prevent the water coming from Lachine and St Henri doing damage to the properties of the citizens of Montreal, but so far I have received no instructions to do so, and in consequence, the cellars of the properties on that street, and also on the adjoining streets, are nearly always flooded in heavy rain storms; therefore, it is necessary to build this sewer, and the cost of same should be charged to these two municipalities, and I would advise the city to notify them notarially of it. You will note by the agreement between the city and these municipalities that they rendered themselves liable for all damages which they might cause to the city. 3. In order to relieve St Catherine street, east of Amherst street, on the old Coteau Harron main sewer, we can make a temporary relief for these floodings by constructing a sewer on St Catherine street between De Lorimier avenue and Papineau road this autumn."
"I would also remind you that a year ago I recommended an intercepting sewer on de Levis street to drain the northeast part of the city; this report has gone before the Finance committee, but we have heard nothing further. It is necessary that this sewer should be constructed in conjunction with the other sewers, which is included in the estimate made by Mr Brittain herewith attached. In conclusion, in regard to the construction of these works recommended, I would recommend that the Sherbrooke street intercepting sewer and de Levis street sewer be let by contract, and that the St James street sewer be done by day work. The reason why I recommend that the work be done by day on St James street sewer is because the ground is swampy and the sewer will be very shallow and the work must be specially done irrespective of cost. Yours truly, (Signed) Perival W St George, City Surveyor."
"When this is complete the by-law will be considered. On Tuesday night there will be a special meeting of the council to take up the gas contract. An effort was made yesterday morning to get a meeting for tomorrow evening, a most unusual thing for the council to meet on Saturday, but after a conference between the City Clerk and those anxious for the meeting, it was deferred to Tuesday night. The Street Railway company owes the city $47,000 for removing the snow from the tracks last winter.

"WRECKED BY A TORNADO Western Town Devastated by an Awful Windstorm Some Train Train Escapes GALESBIMA, Ill, June 14 The tornado passed through the northeastern part of this (Knox) county about eight o'clock last evening and ruin was left all along its path. It first made its appearance northwest of Galva. About 7:30 o'clock two threatening clouds were seen in the west approaching one another, and the tornado is thought to have resulted from their junction. Its course was south and east through that city, and the main body of the storm passed along the main business street of the city. It came with such suddenness that the citizens had no time to fly to places of safety. In the Free Methodist church there was assembled a congregation. In the rink there was gathering a committee to arrange for a Fourth of July celebration. The church was quickly a mass of ruins and the congregation was imprisoned. A number were injured, one dangerously. The rink also was blown down, but those inside managed to escape without injury."
"The church was quickly a mass of ruins and the congregation was imprisoned. A number were injured, one dangerously. The rink also was blown down, but those inside managed to escape without injury. Had the storm come a few minutes later many would have been in the building and a loss of life would surely have resulted. The roar of the storm is described as terrible. It was accompanied by an awful sweep of wind that carried everything before it. Nearly every business house along the principal street was unroofed and stocks of goods badly damaged by the floods of water following the tornado. The Chicago, Burlington and Quincy roundhouse was a total wreck. G.A. Cole's barn was torn to pieces. When the wind struck Clans Peterson's residence it performed a curious operation, cutting it in two. The storm in the vicinity of Lafayette is said to have been severe, but the damage was less than farther north. It was in the Free Methodist church in Galva that most of those injured were hurt. This old building is in the southeast part of the town. A large congregation was assembled, but on seeing and hearing the storm started out and nearly all escaped."
"This old building is in the southeast part of the town. A large congregation was assembled, but on seeing and hearing the storm started out and nearly all escaped. Albert F. Kirkland, although injured, returned to the church and rescued his brother George, who was buried under a mass of rubbish and would have soon been smothered. The edifice was minced to kindling wood. A large crowd soon assembled and assisted in the work of rescue. Mrs. Gus Johnson, whose husband was badly injured, had a thrilling experience. When the storm was near his house he started to run, while she lay down close to the wall. He was stricken down. The only part of the house left standing was the wall close to which Mrs. Johnson was lying. When found she was unconscious from fright. Not a trace is left of a fine house that stood a mile west of Galva. Cheat Faj, Mont, June 14 The Missouri River is higher today than ever known since the existence of this city.

"In an interview with an intimate friend today Sir John Thompson, in answer to a question whether he intended to reply to the attack of Dr. Douglas in the Methodist conference, said: """"Those who know that a man may change his religious views need no explanation. It would be idle to give reasons to those who do not believe that a man may conscientiously become a Catholic."""" A CYCLONE WRECKED BY St. Johns, Que, Swept by a Terrific Windstorm Ottawa A Windstorm St. Johns, Que, June 14 A cyclone passed over the southwestern part of this town about 1:30 this afternoon, carrying destruction in its way. Mr. A. Bertrand lost two buildings completely demolished and part of a large barn used for pressing and storing hay. Two hay presses were also damaged, large beams torn from the buildings destroyed were carried hundreds of feet in the air and deposited in the surrounding yards and gardens. The peculiar noise alarmed the citizens. Those who got out of doors in time viewed a scene seldom witnessed."
"On arriving it was found that the thunderbolt had struck the chimney of the one and a half storey wooden house occupied by Mr. Powers and taking a downward course had carried away the gable end of the house. Fortunately the disaster was not accompanied by fire. The plaster inside was considerably broken and the damage amounts to $6,000. The Damage at Quebec Damage done by last night's storm seems to have been even more extensive than was supposed. The shipping in the Louise Basin suffered considerably. The spars of vessels were damaged and sails torn to shreds and damaged beyond repair. Almost every schooner at the wharves felt the effects of the hurricane. The ship Korwood broke loose from her stern moorings in the basin and had hard work to get back again, assisted by the tugs. The barques Smith and George M. Peak, loading at Commissioners' wharf, drifted out into the stream, taking with them the wharf posts. Both vessels were rescued by the tugs Jones and Victoria. A quantity of timber surrounding the Edith went adrift at the same time. A large portion of it was saved by the tug Three Brothers."
"Both vessels were rescued by the tugs Jones and Victoria. A quantity of timber surrounding the Edith went adrift at the same time. A large portion of it was saved by the tug Three Brothers. On the Louise embankment the wind started several heavily loaded cars and rolled them down the track a long distance before they could be stopped. Along the country roads traces of the storm are visible everywhere. On St. Foy road two large trees on Sleet's farm were blown across the roadway, almost blocking it up. The same thing occurred at the residence of Bissett, on the Charlesbourg road. They had to be removed as they interfered with traffic. In the rear of Bissett's dwelling a barn was wrecked. From other parts of the country come similar reports of destruction, more particularly on the Island of Orleans, where numerous barns and outhouses were brought to the ground. The fences surrounding the old lacrosse grounds and the standing brick walls of the house formerly occupied by Mr. Ross, on St. Louis road, fell a prey to the wind. Fences along the line of Lake St."
"""BKVKBB RAIN STORM The heaviest storm for many years raged throughout Friday night and Saturday last. Torrents of rain fell causing a rapid melting of the snow. The rivers were swollen to an unprecedented extent, causing great destruction of bridges. The bridge across the upper end of St. John's harbor was swept away. It is expected that the news from the outlying districts will tell of serious damage from flooded rivers. A serious wash-out on the St. John's and Harbor Grace railway occurred between Mannels and Holyrood. Traffic is interrupted and more than a week will be required to make the necessary repairs. The line at this place runs close to the seashore. Perrault's petition to be granted one of the rooms in Bonsecours market for gunstsum was referred to the Market committee. Mr. Perrault states that twenty-six aldermen have sanctioned the action. The Mayor read a letter from the Recorder regarding the sending of several children to the reformatory. In answer to Aid. Stevenson, he said the report on the number was in course of preparation."
"""The Mayor read a letter from the Recorder regarding the sending of several children to the reformatory. In answer to Aid. Stevenson, he said the report on the number was in course of preparation. The report of the Road committee recommending the erasure of Cote des Neiges bill widening from the homologated line of the city was objected to by Aid. Stevenson and laid on the table till next meeting. The report of the Road committee regarding Water Avenue caused much discussion, and as a compromise was referred to the Road and Water committee. The report of the Road and Finance committees in reference to the contract with Coie St. Louis and St. Louis de Mile End, granting these corporations the privilege of draining into the city sewers, was considered. By the provisions of the report they are prevented from draining slaughterhouse refuse, etc., into the sewers, and they assume all responsibility for damage caused either in the city or in their own limits by flooding. After some discussion, in which it was contended that the report was not accurate enough on some points, it was left over till next meeting, and the City Attorney was instructed to prepare the contract."
"""MART QUESTIONS ASKED Then the questions began. They were mostly on questions familiar to the public. A gentleman asked for information respecting the duty of the police in regard to the cleaning of the sidewalks, and Aid. Cress was informed that the Health committee was preparing a report regarding the sanitation question. Aid. Nolan stirred up a little storm by asking why St. Ann's ward was not represented on the inundation committee. Aid. Wilson and Germain moved that the names of Aid. Nolan and Stevenson be added, and this caused more trouble. Aid. Nolan having complained of being struck off the committee, Aid. Conroy asked what right Aid. Nolan had to demand to be on the committee. Aid. Nolan replied somewhat warmly to the effect that St. Ann's ward had suffered most from floods, it was most interested in flood prevention, and should not be ignored. Aid. Conroy said he had given way to Aid. Cunningham, who had more property in St. Ann's ward than any of its representatives. Aid. Nolan: By what right does Aid."
"""Aid. Conroy said he had given way to Aid. Cunningham, who had more property in St. Ann's ward than any of its representatives. Aid. Nolan: By what right does Aid. Conroy give away the rights of the people of St. Ann's ward? I'm astonished to hear him talk thus. He must have felt that he was incapable. Aid. Wilson said he did not object to the gentlemen suggested, but he did to cumbersome committee. Aid. Stevenson said if anyone had a right to complain it was himself. He had been systematically ignored in connection with it. He recapitulated the work he had done in preventing floods and continued that as soon as the work was completed, he would be relieved. They had done his working on his ideas. The question then dropped, Aid. Nolan giving notice of motion to have the formation of the committee reconsidered. The Board of Health for the city was appointed, and the assessment roll for grand and petit jurors was approved of. The council then proceeded to settle the financial question at the Mayor's suggestion. Aid."

She got off her course during the blinding storm that prevailed last night and went ashore at the height of the storm. A rocket was accordingly shot across the steamer and the breeches buoy was rigged after some difficulty and the captain and his wife and all the crew of the steamer were safely landed not much the worse for their experience. The yacht Sur-jptl has been wrecked at Donaghadee, county Down. The schooner Jane and Alice foundered off Dungarvan, county Wexford. Her crew were rescued. The anxiety that was felt concerning the safety of the British steamer Sir Walter Raleigh has been allayed by her re-arrival at Bear Haven.

A mail cart going from Limerick to Tullow was buried in the snow. The driver was dug out of the snow half-frozen. The storm has caused heavy losses in livestock. On Saturday there occurred in Limericktown a rare phenomenon which, though often seen at sea, is seldom visible in landlocked harbors. A storm was prevailing at the time and those who were close to the water felt a black heavy cloud drawing near the city. As it arrived over the harbor it could be seen twirling downward and almost immediately the water beneath was thrown into a state of the most violent commotion and there ascended a spiral column that revolved with great rapidity. Everybody watched the sight with great interest. Finally the suspended column of water and the ascending came together and immediately they did so the whole mass fell with an almost deafening crash."

"Sunday evening's despatches brought the news that a very severe blizzard was prevailing in Kansas. This storm has since spread all over the Western states, going as far south as St. Louis, where the phenomenal fall for that latitude of four inches of snow was recorded. Chicago's winds never blew before as they did yesterday and from all points in the Western states come the same reports of unprecedented snowfalls and heavy winds. In Canada the storm, or another, appeared at an early hour yesterday morning, and by six o'clock the electric car services in all the important points west of Toronto had been completely paralyzed. This continent was not alone. The cable reports extraordinarily high winds as prevailing in Great Britain, attended by many shipwrecks, while reports of the same nature come from Europe as far distant as Austria, showing that the European storm was almost as widespread as the American. IN CANADA, Yesterday's Storm Paralysed all the Western Ontario Towns. TORONTO, February 12. The snow storm here was one of the worst recollected by the average citizen."
"IN CANADA, Yesterday's Storm Paralysed all the Western Ontario Towns. TORONTO, February 12. The snow storm here was one of the worst recollected by the average citizen. The streetcar service was badly blocked early in the afternoon and electricity gave way to horse power in the outlying lines. Unchanged street electric cars were kept running with difficulty all day. Drifts were formed in many streets to the depth of several feet. Trains coming into the city were very late. Meetings announced for the evening were in every case very thinly attended, and the streets were empty tonight. No damage in the city is reported from the storm at present. ST. CATHARINES, February 12. A terrific wind and snowstorm has prevailed here most of the day and is still raging. The electric street railway car line is knocked out and traffic generally demoralized. LONDON, LONDON, Ont, February 12. The storm today was the severest that has visited this city this winter and was made up of wind, sleet and snow; it completely paralyzed business."
"LONDON, LONDON, Ont, February 12. The storm today was the severest that has visited this city this winter and was made up of wind, sleet and snow; it completely paralyzed business. The wind reached its greatest velocity about noon and prevailed with undiminished strength for the remainder of the day. Comparatively little snow fell, but what there was was blown into drifts about the sidewalks and pavements. On the eastbound railroads trains were running a little behind time owing to the storm. NIAGARA FALLS, Niagara Falls, Ont, February 12. The worst snowstorm of years struck town this morning. A regular northeast gale blew the snow in all directions. Towards evening the gale reached a terrific force, piling the snow up in piles eight to ten feet deep, completely suspending traffic on the streets. The horse cars to Drummondville shut down for the night early in the afternoon. The electric lines on both sides of the river, after fighting the storm, gave up in despair."
"The horse cars to Drummondville shut down for the night early in the afternoon. The electric lines on both sides of the river, after fighting the storm, gave up in despair. The railways are having their hands full trying to keep their lines open for passenger traffic only; passenger trains on all the lines are running from three to five hours late, freight traffic being abandoned. HAMILTON, Hamilton, February 12. A genuine blizzard struck here today. A snowstorm, accompanied by a very strong northeast wind, has been raging nearly all day. The electric service is entirely suspended and street traffic generally is much impeded. Trains east and west are pretty well on time and from the north and south the service has been kept up fairly well so far. WINDSOR, WINDSOR, Ont, February 12. The Windsor, Sandwich and Walkerville street railway lines were tied up by the storm about 10:30 this morning, and the cars stand in the street where they were deserted by their crews. Traffic and business of all kinds is almost entirely suspended."
"The ferry boats are almost deserted and it is almost impossible to make a landing on the other side. The water in Detroit River is rapidly backing from the lakes below and has risen nearly three feet since yesterday, the current being at a perfect standstill. It is almost an impossibility to run the car ferries, and trains on all roads entering Windsor are several hours behind time. THE AMERICAN END. It Began In Kansas and Ended In the Atlantic. CHICAGO, February 12. The worst blizzard that ever struck this city, so far as the weather bureau records show for twenty-three years, is raging here. Street traffic is greatly impeded and walking is accompanied with great danger to life and limb. Many persons have already been injured by being blown to the ground, against walls and street posts by the wind. The velocity is eighty miles an hour, the highest ever recorded for this city and almost double the velocity of the wind which is blowing a blizzard in the Western states."
"The velocity is eighty miles an hour, the highest ever recorded for this city and almost double the velocity of the wind which is blowing a blizzard in the Western states. The wind was so furious at the corners where skyscrapers are built, especially the Monadnock annex block, bounded by Jackson, Van Buren and Dearborn streets and Custom House place, that extra policemen gave all their attention to the pedestrians. Dozens of women were lifted off their feet and blown to the ground, or else pushed across the streets until they came in violent contact with walls, posts and other obstacles. Mrs. Brahany, of No. 361 South Clinton street, a charwoman at the Art Institute, was lifted in the air and dashed against the fireplug of the Dearborn and Van Buren street corner. Two of her ribs were broken, and it is believed she is internally injured. She lay in the snow drift until men rushed to her rescue, and the police ambulance took her home. The gusts of wind and blinding particles of snow frightened men as well as women from attempting to cross Dearborn street at Van Buren."
"The gusts of wind and blinding particles of snow frightened men as well as women from attempting to cross Dearborn street at Van Buren. The effect of others kept them within sheltering doorways. Civilians and policemen became a volunteer brigade, and on the principle that in union there is strength, they locked arms with the belated police workers and crossed in safety. At the stockyards there was a practical suspension of business all the morning. No buyers were to be seen. Stock trains were late, and when they did arrive were covered with snow. In the suburbs the storm was felt with rather more severity than in the heart of the city. One of the big front windows of the Leland hotel was blown in early this morning at the very beginning of the storm. The glass was blown clear across one of the parlors by the force of the wind, but the window was boarded up before any serious damage was done by the snow. The drifted snow and the high wind played havoc with the mail. Nearly all the mail trains were late, and from some of them no tidings were received until late in the day."
"The drifted snow and the high wind played havoc with the mail. Nearly all the mail trains were late, and from some of them no tidings were received until late in the day. All the roads suffered, both the eastern and western trains being from one to eight hours late. The driving snow made signals on the railroad tracks practically useless, and caused a collision between two freight trains on the West Shore tracks near 97th street and Stoney avenue about noon. Luther J. Webster, fireman on the second train, had his foot crushed. More accidents were reported to the police today resulting from the high wind. In spite of the fearful weather and the condition of the streets the ambulances were kept busy a large part of the day. BLOOMINGTON, Ill., February 12. A violent snowstorm raged throughout central Illinois all today. The snow is ten inches on a level, and is badly drifted. Many trains are delayed, and one passenger train on the Big Four is stuck in a drift near Tremont. There are drifts here five feet deep. INDIANA, FORT WAYNE, February 12."
"Many trains are delayed, and one passenger train on the Big Four is stuck in a drift near Tremont. There are drifts here five feet deep. INDIANA, FORT WAYNE, February 12. The great blizzard reached this city at four o'clock this morning and is still raging. All streetcar traffic was abandoned at an early hour. Every railroad centering here is blocked and traffic is practically suspended on all lines. WABASH, February 12. The heaviest snowstorm of the season raged here yesterday and today. The wind blew sixty miles an hour. The thermometer was below zero and the suffering among the poorly clad and half-housed people on the big prairie north of here is fearful. NEW YORK, SARANAC LAKE, February 12. The worst storm of the season is now raging here. The thermometer has dropped 42 degrees in four hours and now registers eight below zero. Snow is falling and aided by a terrific west wind is drifting badly. NEW YORK, February 12. The city tonight is covered with a mantle of snow several inches thick. Travel of all kinds is greatly impeded."
"Snow is falling and aided by a terrific west wind is drifting badly. NEW YORK, February 12. The city tonight is covered with a mantle of snow several inches thick. Travel of all kinds is greatly impeded. The storm is the most severe one of the season and is expected to last until tomorrow night or Wednesday morning. The thermometer is down to 20 degrees, and the wind is blowing from the northeast at the rate of thirty miles an hour. Railroad traffic is almost demoralized. All trains are behind time, and the mails from the south and west are greatly delayed. The ferry houses are blocked with belated passengers waiting for the overdue ferry boats, which are compelled to run at a considerably reduced rate of speed. The elevated railroad trains are delayed. The effect of the snow is felt on the outskirts of the city, and the markets are stagnated by the lack of farm produce, the roads being almost impassable on account of deep snow drifts. Sergeant Dunn, of the weather bureau, said tonight that this storm was but the advance guard of one more severe, which would be followed by a very cold wave."
"Sergeant Dunn, of the weather bureau, said tonight that this storm was but the advance guard of one more severe, which would be followed by a very cold wave. Danger signals have been ordered up all along the coast and vessels have been warned not to leave port. At the rate the snow is falling tonight it will be a foot deep by the morning. Reports from all points throughout the state indicate that the storm is general and very severe and that traffic is greatly impeded; trains are badly delayed everywhere. Despatches from New Jersey report a similar state of affairs. The storm along the New Jersey and Long Island coast is particularly severe. A high northeast gale prevails, and the air is thick with flying snow. Mariners off the coast will have a hard night of it. It is probable that several wrecks will be reported tomorrow. The life-saving crews have doubled their patrols and are on the alert so as to promptly answer signals of distress. One wreck was reported tonight. It occurred on Rockaway Beach, opposite the Arverne hotel."
"The life-saving crews have doubled their patrols and are on the alert so as to promptly answer signals of distress. One wreck was reported tonight. It occurred on Rockaway Beach, opposite the Arverne hotel. The Arverne life-saving crew cannot go to the relief of the vessel on account of the blinding snowstorm and the high and heavy sea which prevails. The vessel is stranded some distance off shore, and her size or the crew she carries cannot be ascertained. The fate of the crew is in doubt, but their position is an extremely dangerous one. NEBRASKA, OMAHA, Neb., February 12. Nebraska is snowbound. For the past twenty-four hours a terrific blizzard has prevailed throughout the state. The fall has been about twelve inches and, following the eight-inch fall of snow on Thursday, makes the depth at least twenty inches. The cold is extremely severe with few exceptions. Omaha traffic of every description is suspended. Trains in every direction last night were abandoned. The mail trains are being got through with difficulty. The high wind has been piling the snow in great drifts."
"Omaha traffic of every description is suspended. Trains in every direction last night were abandoned. The mail trains are being got through with difficulty. The high wind has been piling the snow in great drifts. Reports from the interior show stock is in good condition and farmers are pleased with the immense snowfalls, as it assures a fine winter wheat crop. OHIO, CLEVELAND, February 12. A severe wind and snowstorm from the northwest struck this city this morning. Nearly all trains are late. Streetcar traffic is almost entirely suspended. FREMONT, O., February 12. In a blinding snowstorm, which had been raging all morning, freight train No. 40, westbound, and eastbound light freight No. 25, on the Wheeling and Lake Erie railroad, collided two miles west of Bellevue about 10:30 o'clock. Both engines and several freight cars were smashed and piled up in confusion. Engineer Connell, of light freight No. 25; Fireman McMullen, of engine No. 25; Brakeman Johnson, of freight engine No."
"Engineer Connell, of light freight No. 25; Fireman McMullen, of engine No. 25; Brakeman Johnson, of freight engine No. 28; and Engineer Samuel Stowell, of engine No. 28, were killed. MISSOURI, ST. LOUIS, Mo., February 12. Without warning from the weather bureau a veritable Kansas blizzard struck this city at 11 o'clock last night and continued up to 6 o'clock tonight. Rain, hail, sleet and snow alternately swept over the city before a high wind. At daylight the street railways had abandoned efforts to run cars till the tracks were cleared by snow plows. All the railway trains that were not abandoned entirely were late, the Alton express from Chicago being eight hours behind time. The snow is four inches deep, which is phenomenal for this latitude, as time passed the storm increased in severity and at 2 p.m. the wind had risen to a 30-mile gait, with the thermometer 8 degrees above zero and falling. The casualties are numerous, but none serious."
"the wind had risen to a 30-mile gait, with the thermometer 8 degrees above zero and falling. The casualties are numerous, but none serious. The overhead wires look like masses of white ropes and many have been snapped by the weight of ice. Two horses were shocked to death by coming in contact with a broken live wire. Telegrams from all points from the South and West show that the storm is widespread and disastrous. MISSISSIPPI, NEW ORLEANS, February 12. Advices received here today and tonight indicate that a storm approaching in violence a cyclone is raging in Mississippi, and that the town of Newton has been wiped out of existence, but as the telegraph wires are all down full particulars cannot be obtained. MEMPHIS, Tenn., February 12. A special from Jackson, Miss., says: A terrible cyclone passed between Martinsville and Beauregard, 40 miles south of here, at a late hour at night within a few miles of a patch of the terrible cyclone of April, 1884. The cyclone was about a mile wide and everything in its path was leveled."
"The cyclone was about a mile wide and everything in its path was leveled. A great many houses were swept from their foundations, trees twisted off, fences destroyed, several people killed and a great many seriously injured. KANSAS, KANSAS CITY, February 12. The worst snowstorm in years raged all over Kansas and Missouri last night and today, for not a single train was on time. The snow averaged from one foot to two feet on the level. High winds accompanied it, and at some points it is 20 feet deep. In many sections schools were closed today. In towns with street railways the service was paralyzed. The snow was dry and the telegraph service was not injured. TOPEKA, Kan., February 12. All railroads in Kansas are blockaded with snow and scarcely a wheel is turning in the state. VESSELS ASHORE, LONG BRANCH, COLD WEATHER. That Is What the Probs Say of Today's Weather. Meteorological Office, Toronto, Ont, February 12, 11 p.m."
"The proof offered by the plaintiff brings this item up to $195.50. The defendant has offered proof on this point, which reduces this item to $116.97. I am disposed to adopt this latter figure. There is another item which I think it is reasonable to award to the plaintiff. The circumstances of the case were such as to require an examination by experts before bringing the action. This the plaintiff did and the value of these services is proved in the case as follows: THE RAILWAYS BLOCKADED New York Has to Go Back Ten Years for a Storm as Big and Boston to 1881 for a Comparison. New York, November 27. When the people of New York awoke this morning they found the blizzard that raged when they retired was still in progress. The storm, which had begun with the soft, sleety snow on Saturday, at noon had increased greatly, and with the heavier snowfall, the wind was blowing a gale at midnight. There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell, and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly."
"There was a slight abatement of the wind this morning, but the snow still fell, and drifted high, and the temperature dropped rapidly. It looked this morning as though the blizzard would continue all day, but at 10 o'clock there was a breaking away in the west, a brightening of the light, and finally the storm ceased altogether, and the greatest blizzard since the memorable one of March, 1888, came to an end. With the brightening of the skies in this city this morning, came an increase in the velocity of the wind, and the loose dry snow was sent swirling and eddying everywhere. Nearly a foot of snow had fallen, but in places it had drifted to four and five feet. Broadway and all the great thoroughfares of the city presented a fantastic appearance. There were drifts on the sidewalks through which the early morning wayfarer ploughed to his waist. In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity."
"In some of the streets great drifts formed barriers across them, and in many instances filled up the trenches that were dug by the street railroads for the transforming of the motive power from cable to electricity. As soon as there were signs of abatement in the fall of snow, the street cleaning department went to work. But there was very little progress made. The street railroad ploughs had thrown up huge banks of snow on either side of the rails, forming an almost impassable barrier to anything but sleighs, very few of which were out. The street cleaning department, with its limited resources, removed a few thousand loads from the principal thoroughfares, but this made an impression on the banks that was scarcely noticeable. CAR LINES BLOCKED Today the cable roads were more fortunate than the trolley lines. Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable. Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile."
"Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile. Suburban traffic was blocked for several hours in the morning and after that trains ran at long intervals. All trains were delayed. Some that were due in the early morning hours had not been heard from at night. The superintendent of mails in the general Post Office reported that the mail train from Boston, due at 6 a.m., had not been heard from, nor had the mails been received up to 10 o'clock tonight. The incoming mails from other parts, he said, were from two hours to an unknown number of hours behind time. The damage to small shipping in the harbor and down the bay was very great. It is reported tonight that several tug boats belonging to the Kingston Towing Company, together with a large number of canal boats, were sunk up the river by the force of the gale. The shores of the Hudson are littered with wreckage. At 9 o'clock this morning a fleet of twenty-two ocean-going steamships were anchored in the bay."
"The shores of the Hudson are littered with wreckage. At 9 o'clock this morning a fleet of twenty-two ocean-going steamships were anchored in the bay. The Lucania, more than 21 hours behind her schedule, was the first of the liners to weigh anchor and put to sea. The others bound east and south followed soon after, one by one. An order was sent out from police headquarters to the various precinct commanders to have arrested all persons found alone in a condition that would raise even the suspicion of intoxication. As a result, the police courts today were crowded with eminently respectable looking persons who were let go with a small fine and an admonition to get in out of the snow. Notwithstanding this precaution on the part of the police, there were a number of casualties, including several deaths from exposure. HIT BOSTON, TOO Boston, Mass, November 27."
"Notwithstanding this precaution on the part of the police, there were a number of casualties, including several deaths from exposure. HIT BOSTON, TOO Boston, Mass, November 27. A record-breaking November blizzard swept over the greater portion of New England last night and today, completely demoralizing traffic of every description and well nigh paralysing telegraphic and telephonic communication, while the northeast gale, coming on a high course of tides, drove the sea far beyond its usual limits and made a mark along shore only exceeded by the memorable hurricane of 1801. The heaviest part of the storm was in the southwestern part of New England, that section experiencing a snowfall of from 18 to 24 inches. Fortunately the storm was heralded sufficiently in advance by the Weather Bureau to detain most of the coastwise shipping in safe harbors, but the warning was entirely ignored by those on shore, with the result that nearly everyone, especially the railroads and electric companies, were caught napping and suffered accordingly. There was not a railroad in New England that was not more or less tied up by the storm."
"There was not a railroad in New England that was not more or less tied up by the storm. Trains north, east, south, and west were nearly all stalled early in the night, although one train from Bangor reached Lynn this morning, and two Chicago trains came into the city this evening. In cities and towns dependent upon electric car service it was even worse, for the damp snow packed hard on the rails and held up even the very snow ploughs. The service in this city was probably the best of any of the surrounding communities, yet even here there was no attempt made to run more than a dozen cars on Wellington Street and one or two others of the main thoroughfares. During the gale last night and this morning thirty barges and schooners lying in Boston harbor were wrecked and sunk and at least twelve lives lost. The Wilson liner Ohio is ashore at Spectacle Island, in the bay. No serious damage is expected. Only the barest reports were received tonight of the effects of the storm on the coast, but even those gave rise to the gravest fears for the safety of what little shipping may have been off Cape Cod last night or today."
"Only the barest reports were received tonight of the effects of the storm on the coast, but even those gave rise to the gravest fears for the safety of what little shipping may have been off Cape Cod last night or today. It will probably be two or three days before a complete list of the disasters can be made. All points south of this city and east of Providence were isolated early in the evening, New Bedford being lost to the outside world before eight o'clock, while Newport and Fall River disappeared into the night long after. Farther to the west at Providence and in other parts of Rhode Island, communication was intermittent and subject to great delay. Night trains over the shore line to New York reached Providence with only a few minutes delay, but beyond that point they met terrific drifts, and it was morning before either of the two regular trains reached New London. Here they were stalled nearly all day by freight wrecks in the road between that point and New Haven. AT OTHER POINTS Hartford, Conn, November 27. The storm in this city is the heaviest known since the blizzard of 1888."
"AT OTHER POINTS Hartford, Conn, November 27. The storm in this city is the heaviest known since the blizzard of 1888. The snow is about two feet on a level, and is drifted badly. Trains on the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad were much delayed. The train from New York Saturday night reached here at 4 o'clock this afternoon, 14 hours behind time. Trolley travel has been entirely suspended during the day, but some short lines are being cleared up this evening. John A. Horn, an electrician, was killed on the Glastonbury line this morning while working at clearing the track. He was shifting the trolley bar when he was struck by a snow plow. Nyack, N.Y, November 27. A storm raged through Rockland County last night and today, doing much damage. The snow drifts are from three to seven feet high, and have made traveling through the county impossible on some roads. This has been the severest snowstorm since 1888. St. John B, November 27."
"The snow drifts are from three to seven feet high, and have made traveling through the county impossible on some roads. This has been the severest snowstorm since 1888. St. John B, November 27. Winter struck in with a rush this morning, a furious northeast gale prevailing all day. The wind blew down chimneys on St. Luke's and the Coburg Street churches, breaking valuable stained glass windows, overturning trees and sweeping down fences in many parts of the city. Only about three inches of snow fell, but the drifts steadily demolished the street railway service, which was caught napping. AS TO KING MENELEK British Policy Is to Compel Him to Stay at Home Not Much Credence Placed in the Story That He Has Taken to the Warpath With 100,000 Men London, November 27. There has been much wild telegraphing from Rome, Cairo and elsewhere about the mysterious movements of King Menelek. Most of these rumors come from Rome, where Menelek is somewhat of a bogey."
"The recent comparatively mild weather which has prevailed in Great Britain has been interrupted by a thorough blizzard in many parts of the country, especially in the North, where the snowdrifts have been several feet deep. Three men perished in the snow in the Highlands, a train was blown off the rails near Tralee, Ireland, numbers of fishing boats have been lost, many fishermen have perished, and the Irish mail boats and cross-channel mail services were interrupted or seriously delayed. The Belfast mail boat was twenty hours in making a trip which is usually accomplished in six hours, trains have been snowed up at several places, and, generally, the snowstorm is considered to have been the worst for many years. The severe weather reached as far south as the Mediterranean, where a French transport, bound for Tunis, was obliged to return to Toulon in a damaged condition. She also reported that some of the recruits on board of her were killed or injured during the storm. THE QUEEN Queen Victoria is taking keen interest just now in the progress of the scheme for connecting Cape Town with Cairo."
"She also reported that some of the recruits on board of her were killed or injured during the storm. THE QUEEN Queen Victoria is taking keen interest just now in the progress of the scheme for connecting Cape Town with Cairo. She conversed with General Lord Kitchener on the subject during his recent visit to Her Majesty, and she expressed the hope of living to see it carried through. The dislike of the Queen for the late William K. Gladstone was well known, but since the death of the great statesman Her Majesty has given several proofs of her kindly regard for Mrs. Gladstone, the widow. She has written frequently to the latter, enquiring very compassionately regarding her health, and expressing the hope that her bereavement has now lost its keenness. Mrs. Gladstone has been greatly touched by the tenderness and sympathy which marked these epistles. Her health has improved during the last few weeks. There is some discussion this week as to whether the Queen will again go to the south of France next spring, in view of the Anglophobe feeling excited by the Fashoda dispute."

Bulletin, November 27. The worst storm experienced for years in this region prevailed all this afternoon and evening and was still raging at a V. The storm began with a couple of inches between daylight and noon, when rain, mixed with snow and wind began to blow a furious gale from the east. The Allan steamer Parisian, due from England with the Canadian mail, and the Halifax, did not arrive. DOWN CANAL. November 26. Down Schooner Oliver Mitchell, lost 60 to 80 tons."
"Allan, Murray, Torrance and other shipping firms, are moving in the matter of obtaining an increase of the Harbour Police, and a memorial to that effect will be prepared and forwarded at an early date to the Minister of Marine. The merchants claim that there is an evident necessity for increased protection this year, as, aside from the announced intention of the ship laborers to hold out for higher wages and their determination not to give in to their demands, which may result in trouble, the accommodation of the harbour is being increased and the force at its present strength is not adequate to the protection of the shipping along the extended line of wharves. Trains Delayed. The heavy snowstorms of the last day or two have seriously impeded the train service, and most of the trains have been greatly delayed. The Western yesterday morning was six hours late, and the New York trains on the Vermont Central and Delaware & Hudson, about three hours. The Ottawa train on the Canada Atlantic, due at 8:55 on Monday evening, did not arrive until 8 o'clock yesterday morning. The North Shore line was reported clear last night, and the service will be on time today."
"The models number eighteen, and are the work respectively of L. W. Gooderham, President of the Credit Valley Railway, Mr. S. Barker, solicitor of the North & Northwestern Railway, and Mr. Bosworth, General Freight Agent of the Canadian Pacific Railway, who are in the city today. Mr. Wiggins, the storm prophet, has received a large number of postal cards, one from Chicago promising him a drubbing, should he visit that city. The snowfall yesterday in this district will average about six inches. Snow fell in the city until 3 o'clock this morning. The trains today were all late. Major-General Strange, of Kingston, is in the city. The missing grocer, Frederick Plunkett, not having turned up, his store, known as Cregan & Plunkett's, was this morning attached by the sheriff's deputy for the sum of $300, due the estate of his late deceased partner, John Cregan.

"The Lower Town Street Railway Company carried more passengers last year than in any year since they have been running. The Quebec Chess Club meets tonight for the purpose of arranging a return match with the Toronto Chess Club. Mr. B., March 30. A very heavy rainstorm has prevailed all day, which had the effect of clearing off most of the snow. The rain is a great boon just now, as the water in the river supplying the city has been unusually low of late. Toronto, March 30. A fire in Porleh's auction rooms, Yonge Street, early this morning, damaged the building and stock about $1,000, partially insured. March 20. Ten inches of snow fell last night, and this morning a hard snowstorm still prevails. At Plattsburg ten inches, at Ausable Forks eight, at Port Henry six, and at Whitehall five inches fell.

"Claiming fortune. Des Moines, March 20. Reports from this section show that the apple orchards have been killed by the severe winter. One farmer lost two hundred trees. The estimated loss on the apple crop in this county alone will be two million bushels. Small fruits are also damaged. Wheat crop impaired. Chicago, March 20.

"ANN H WARD, Aid, Patrick Kennedy asked the chairman of the Road committee if he could kindly send some men and carts out to Forfar and Conway streets, point St. Charles, to have the piles of snow removed. Residents of the locality were put to great inconvenience by the huge piles of snow now accumulated on the streets. He also asked that the snow should be removed from Grey Nun and King streets, as it interfered with the traffic to the merchants' stores. Aid Laurent said that there were mountains of snow all over the city. Already $30,000 has been expended in removing it, and they did not know what to do even now. Seven hundred and fifty men and 450 carters were employed and the Road committee could not please everyone. Aid Kennedy complained that snow and ice taken from the streets should be dumped on St. Patrick's square. He believed some more suitable place could be found than this. Aid Laurent said he would do his best in the matter and endeavor to carry out Aid Kennedy's wishes. Aid Cunningham then said he was on four committees: the markets, fire, health and light."
"Yesterday afternoon one of the boarders came home early and was considerably astonished to find the new man going through a trunk belonging to one of the others. He detained him until the owner of the trunk came in, which he did at 6 o'clock, rather the worse for liquor. On his asking the new man what he was doing in his trunk, the only reply he got was a punch on the nose. A row ensued and the new man was mastered and Chief Detective Cullen sent for. On arrival they wanted the trunk riller to be arrested, but said they would not prosecute, so Cullen refused to make the arrest, the trunk's owner then settled matters by kicking the other man into the street. THE SNOWSTORM Again Demoralizes Railway Travel on Certain Routes A Slight Accident. With the exception of the Delaware & Hudson and Central Vermont trains, all incoming trains arrived nearly on time last night. The Delaware & Hudson is stuck between St. John and Rouse's Point. The Central Vermont is reported an hour and a half late. The Canada Atlantic ran off the track on the way in, and one of the cars was upset in a snowbank."

Dr. Laberge, some time ago, reported a number of these cases, saying that it was very dangerous to public health, and the matter was referred to the Road committee and there it rests, for the road department claims it is the duty of the police to look after the nuisance, and the police claim it is the duty of the Health department.

"It appears that certain parties are routing out vacant lots owned by them as public dumps, and in those is dumped all the dirty snow taken from yards, the owner of the lot receiving as compensation about two cents a load. The residents in the vicinity very naturally complain of this, as when the hot weather comes the melted snow will probably cause a nuisance.

"ST. PAUL STREET, between McGill and St. Francois Xavier Street, where the level is very low, was soon covered, it flowing into the cellars of the stores alone, filling them, coming as high as the window sills in some cases. Carts and express wagons were brought into requisition, and such goods as were exposed to danger and had not already been ruined were removed, some to higher ground and others to the upper storeys. On H'ALL STREET the water came up past St. Ann's market, which was surrounded, though the floor was not reached, and no damage was done in the battle of the building. The cellars, as well as those along Foundling and Grey Nun streets, were filled. So also were those in the blocks to the south. The Custom House stood like an islet and the clerks had to make their way out in carts and cabs. The Allan steamship office and the Harbor Commissioners' building were in the same fix. About 2 o'clock or a little later a slight fall took place and the water retired somewhat, but it was for a short time only."
"The Allan steamship office and the Harbor Commissioners' building were in the same fix. About 2 o'clock or a little later a slight fall took place and the water retired somewhat, but it was for a short time only. By 3 o'clock it was higher in the streets than ever. McGill was covered as far as the Albion hotel, and the water had risen and covered the sections of Wellington, William and intersecting streets. At 10 o'clock the state of things was worse at night than on the city side of the canal. In Congregation, Wellington, Hacdalen, Consol, Forfar, Grand Trunk, Richardson, Patrick and other streets the water rose to a height of two or three feet, according to the level. The sidewalks floated round and were used by the inhabitants as rafts to keep up communication with each other. At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water."
"At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water. There were of course many incidents, some of them laughable, some of them sad, connected with the flood. Men and boys constructed rafts and paddled round on them; express wagons were in use as ferries and conveyed loads of waiting people, men and women, to their homes, not a few of which were partly under water. Large crowds of people collected in the affected districts and stood in groups watching the water as it slowly crept up, bearing with it blocks of ice, which stranded on the street as it would ebb for a short time, only to return with greater volume within a comparatively short period. The chief cause of the flood was doubtless the breaking-up of the ice in the reaches above the Lachine Rapids. At Beauharnois on Friday night the lake ice began to move. From Vaudreuil on Saturday morning came the news that the ice was passing down taking with it wharves and buildings close to the shore."
"At Beauharnois on Friday night the lake ice began to move. From Vaudreuil on Saturday morning came the news that the ice was passing down taking with it wharves and buildings close to the shore. The mass, with the accompanying flood, piling up on an already jammed front of the city, continually aggravated the trouble, till the flood in Montreal exceeded anything in the memory of the oldest inhabitant, surpassing, it is estimated, by several feet that of the year 1861. The Lachine Rapids have obliterated, so high has the river risen. The country for miles on the south side of the river was covered. From the mountain top, far as the eye could reach, nothing could be seen on the south but a vast expanse of water spreading over the country. Prairie village must have suffered terribly though no detailed advices have been received as to the exact character of the damage done. It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered."
"Prairie village must have suffered terribly though no detailed advices have been received as to the exact character of the damage done. It is said that over the low land between that village and St. Johns the whole country is covered. The water flows over the district south of the canal, the banks of which have heretofore formed a sort of safeguard to the section north of it. But this year, so high is the flood, that the water in the neighborhood of the sugar refinery flows over the walls into the canal itself, and then over the upper bank into William Street, down which it pours. In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected. Craig Street and St. Antoine Street from St. Henri Street to St. Urbain Street is covered. Victoria Square is a lake. The low part of Vitre Street in rear of the drill shed is flooded, and the cellars of the houses in the neighborhood filled. Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street."
"Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street. It is impossible at the present time to form any estimate of the damage that has been done on the flooded streets. It would be easier to say who had not than who had suffered. Coming higher than was anticipated, higher than was ever before known, the water reached many houses and business places that made no preparation for such an event, and it was in these that the greatest damage occurred. THE SCENES ON SUNDAY. About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning a sudden rise took place, filling many cellars that had hitherto escaped, as far from the river Craig Street, among these those of the Gazette and St. Lawrence Hall. At 11 o'clock another rise took place, and by 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon had flooded the low-lying parts of the central district of the city. The Central fire station, on Craig Street, was surrounded by water, and the firemen had to go in and out for a boat."
"The Central fire station, on Craig Street, was surrounded by water, and the firemen had to go in and out for a boat. The water extended along to Victoria Square and up to Jurors Street, and even those driving in cabs did not escape without wet feet, for the carriages were nearly up in the shafts. On Honavenltir Street, a little west of Victoria Square, the water suddenly made its appearance and spread along as far as the eye could reach. The street was also submerged from HUGH beyond the American building to some distance past Craig Street. St. Antoine Street was in a similar condition, which was flooded up to St. Maurice Street and the gallery of the Albion Hall was crowded all day by visitors, waiting on the busy street. There were three feet of water on the ground floor of the main building. The water was literally covered with rafts, boats and debris of all descriptions, and the streets were in constant communication with the main roads and accidents were numerous."
"There were three feet of water on the ground floor of the main building. The water was literally covered with rafts, boats and debris of all descriptions, and the streets were in constant communication with the main roads and accidents were numerous. One man, having broken up a raft and cast its remnants into the water, was laughing at the predicament he found himself in when he drove into the water, giving a sudden lurch that sent him into the water too. Accidents were numerous in the flooded streets and furnished a source of innocent merriment to onlookers. The district between Wellington and St. Peter Streets, which lies lower than the eastern part of the business section, suffered more, and in some places the water rose to St. Sacrament Street where two merchants were driving brisk trade, conveying merchants and their employees to and from the different stores at exorbitant prices. Quite a number of men were seen with rubber boots up to their thighs trudging through the water, rather than pay fifty cents for a seat of 200 or 300 feet. But in St. Paul Street and the adjacent districts the water was far too deep for pedestrianism."
"But in St. Paul Street and the adjacent districts the water was far too deep for pedestrianism. Numbers of men could be seen hanging around unable to reach their homes which they had left on Saturday morning to go to work, and some of those poor fellows had scarcely anything to eat in the interval. Their plight was pitiable in the extreme. Joe Leof's being flooded out, most of his customers could be seen sitting on the doorstep looking disconsolately at the waste of waters, flowing eastwards towards Jarry Park where the bank rises. The water did not extend so far, and people were able to go down as far as Commissioners Street. The ice was not broken up nearly so much as jammed, and presented the appearance of a solid sheet, slightly roughened on top, the only evidences of shifts having taken place being the encumbrance of ice along the revetment wall and the cronkedness of the river roads. Some of these started out in a straight line, and continued so for a few hundred yards, when they suddenly stopped, and to find the continuation one had to look a quarter of a mile down stream."
"Some of these started out in a straight line, and continued so for a few hundred yards, when they suddenly stopped, and to find the continuation one had to look a quarter of a mile down stream. The dump seems to have grounded on the long wharf, and there it will probably stay. The whole population of the town seemed to have gathered in the central district to watch the progress of the flood, and many were speculating on the chances of a lengthened period of enforced idleness. All afternoon the water continued to rise, and by six o'clock Craig Street was impassable west from St. Urbain Street. The basements of the houses had long been flooded, but now the water rose over the side streets and the district between St. Denis and St. Lawrence Main was soon covered. Between Craig and Vitre, St. Constant and German Streets were perhaps the worst, and from the houses planks had been laid to the floating sidewalks. St. Elizabeth and Sanguinet were also partially covered, and Vitre Street in places resembled a chain of miniature lakes. St. Charles Borromeo, St."
"St. Elizabeth and Sanguinet were also partially covered, and Vitre Street in places resembled a chain of miniature lakes. St. Charles Borromeo, St. Urbain and Cote Streets were also submerged, and boats and rafts were plying here and there. The Central Fire Station on Craig Street was also invaded, and in a few moments the men's bedroom was under water and everything soaking. EXTENT OF THE AFFECTED DISTRICT. At 11 o'clock the water extended up St. Urbain Street, about fifty yards above Craig Street and from Craig up Alexander Street to Vitre, remaining the same; on Cote Street it was up to the Theatre Royal, and rose as high as the hubs of carriage wheels on Vitre, between St. George and Chenneville. On the upper side of Vitre Street a building, the foundations of which were completed, was filled to the level of the sidewalk. The water extended several yards above Vitre on St. George."
"George and Chenneville. On the upper side of Vitre Street a building, the foundations of which were completed, was filled to the level of the sidewalk. The water extended several yards above Vitre on St. George. In order to reach the western end of the lower portion of the city a detour had to be made by way of Palace Street to Cathedral, as the water covered St. Antoine to past Ste. Montpie, and fully flooded St. David's Lane. Driving along St. Antoine the stretch of water covering St. James West and the railway was clearly visible on passing every side street, and it was not till Fillfold Street was reached that a passage to Notre Dame Street West could be effected. On St. James Street West the flood almost reached the corner of Fulford, several yards of which latter street were under water, which flowed into many basements to the depth of four feet, covering the stoves and quenching the household fires. A room was impassable to foot passengers, and sundry express wagons, owned by enterprising drivers, ferried people across at the moderate sum of five cents per head."
"A room was impassable to foot passengers, and sundry express wagons, owned by enterprising drivers, ferried people across at the moderate sum of five cents per head. From halfway between Craig and Vitre, on Bleury Street, wagons were employed in transporting passengers to the higher ground on St. Peter, while a number of people were floating on improvised rafts, made from portions of sidewalks, on all the streets east from Victoria Square to Cote. At the corner of the latter and Craig incidents were numerous, some of which resulted in many people getting wet. Several photographers were observed taking views of the flooded streets. At night numerous boats flitted along St. Antoine, Bonaventure, McGill and other streets. AT POINT ST. CHARLES the suffering must be most severe. The water has risen to a height fully two feet higher than during the inundation last May. The wind is strong. At the Grand Trunk office the water came up to the desk at the innermost end. The works are, of course, stopped, only by last accounts communication is kept up."
"The wind is strong. At the Grand Trunk office the water came up to the desk at the innermost end. The works are, of course, stopped, only by last accounts communication is kept up. Several horses are known to have been drowned, and no doubt not a few cows have met like fate. The people are in a sad plight. Not only are they without means of communication, but many are without food or the means of obtaining it, for but few of the retailers in the affected districts are able to run. Even if it were still the waters recede, it would be impractical to reach it. At the station no trains arrived yesterday. The cars in the yard stand in the water. At Our Street an engine was caught by the rising flood, submerged and its course stopped. """"Bill AMATS!"""" Boatmen who have established their businesses at several points are evidently determined to make all they can of their particular situation, and exorbitant prices from whoever seeks to use their means of transportation."
"All trains have been shipped and washouts have occurred in several places. An unbroken is reported on the track at St. Louis, which village, or the greater part of it, is covered with water. The suburbs have suffered severely. The Gazette's press, engine and electric light rooms are five feet deep. The basement is affected in a minor degree. The Withee establishment on Bonaventure Street is surrounded by water and the cellar as well as those of other buildings in that vicinity flooded. The police station on St. Nicholas Street is in a like fix. All will, it is understood, be more or less dependent on their more fortunate rivals for assistance in making their regular appearance today. Proceeding to the riverbanks, a rumor was sent the rounds last night that an attempt would be made to start the jam which it was said existed at Longue Pointe. The name of Aid. Stevenson, chairman of the inundation committee, was mentioned as having the thing in hand and learning that the City Hall was to be made the starting point, a Gazette reporter went there."
"The name of Aid. Stevenson, chairman of the inundation committee, was mentioned as having the thing in hand and learning that the City Hall was to be made the starting point, a Gazette reporter went there. Joe Vincent, the well-known boatman, was on hand and was ready to place himself at the disposal of Aid. Stevenson. That gentleman arrived in the Central Station, accompanied by Captain Beckingham, of the salvage corps, who, acting on instructions, had roused the colonel from his sleep and brought him down. The theory was that the deep navigation cutting was the cause of the jam, and that it was loaded about Thibaudeau at Longue Pointe. Col. Stevenson proceeded to investigate, and as a result came to the conclusion that any attempt, such as suggested, would be fruitless. In the first place, Vincent gave it as his opinion that the placing of dynamite would be a most dangerous work, and that after it was placed it was ten to one that it would not do any good. The scheme was dropped as of no use, and the chairman of the inundation committee got home again. NOW THE RIVER."
"The scheme was dropped as of no use, and the chairman of the inundation committee got home again. NOW THE RIVER. Saturday night's advices from down river ports were that at Three Rivers the lake ice was on the move since 2 p.m. Lachine reported a slight shove accompanied by a rise, and then a fall in the water. At Berthierville the ice was rotten and it was hoped the river would be clear by today. Looking down the river from Montreal at dusk no sign of a break-up was apparent; as far as the eye could reach was one stretch of rugged ice pack, unbroken except in one or two very small patches. Over towards St. Lambert the same view presented itself, the only extent of water visible being where Commissioners Street was five feet under water. Here the current swept along at the rate of four or five miles an hour. Many of the stevedores' offices, placed on the street for safety during the winter, have been upset and are liable to be crushed or carried off when the final rush takes place. The office and sheds of the R.K.O."
"As a matter of precaution only the inside track was used. There was absolutely no change in the ice from 2 till 10 o'clock. RELIEFS OR RELIEF. Colonel Stevenson, chairman of the inundation committee, last evening gave orders to Fraser, Viger & Co. for packages of tea, coffee and other provisions to be distributed among the sufferers. The firm were consequently at work all night, and this morning will have a large supply ready for immediate distribution. Captain Beckingham also received orders from him to load up the spare salvage wagon with bread from Mr. Strachan's bakery and drive it down to McGill Street where it will be taken in boats and distributed about the poor people. The work of relief will be begun at 8:30 this morning. The presidents of the national societies held an informal meeting last night to discuss what means it would be advisable to take to distribute relief. In Point St. Charles the water was reported to be from 18 to 24 inches higher than during the late flood. The police have a boat mounted on a truck to be driven to fires."
"In Point St. Charles the water was reported to be from 18 to 24 inches higher than during the late flood. The police have a boat mounted on a truck to be driven to fires. The Royal Electric Lighting Company's factory was flooded last night, and the water having entered the gas pipes the submerged district was almost in total darkness. Many of the principal buildings were lighted by lamps or candles. Dr. Thayer called on the Mayor last night and informed him that the water had backed up until it was flush with the head of the Lachine Rapids, and that there was great danger of its bursting over the banks and sweeping down over the flats. He urged His Worship to have the jam at Longueuil blown up with dynamite. The Mayor, who was very sick, gave his authorization to anything that could be done, and referred Dr. Thayer to Aid. Stevenson, who, however, found that the project was not feasible. At 2 o'clock this morning Aid. Stevenson was making a raid on the St. Lawrence Hall for provisions for the men working at the pumps."
"JAMES STREET WEST MONTREAL, 330 orders received by telephone LACHINE CANAL, NOTICE is hereby given that, circumstances permitting, the water will be drawn out of the Lachine Canal on SATURDAY, the 10th Inst, or as soon as the state of the ice will permit, and will remain out until the necessary repairs have been made.

London, Ont, April 6 The worst snow storm for years visited London this morning and has continued until evening with unabated violence. The wind blew strongly from the east and northeast and leveled quite a number of fences and shade trees in the outskirts, it was the most unspring-like day of the season and even streetcar traffic was to a certain extent paralyzed by the storm. The storm had the effect of seriously retarding the traffic on the southern division and this afternoon the passenger trains were barely able to make any progress through the snow that is piled thick and high on the line, especially on the west end. The telegraph lines are down in a score of places."

London, October 22 A despatch to the Times from Melbourne, Victoria, says that experts have been sent to the United States by Queensland to report upon Texas fever in cattle, which is identical with a disease caused by a Queensland insect like a tick. ROME, October 23 Torrential rains have fallen throughout Upper Italy and all rail trains are delayed in consequence. High tides have prevailed in the Venice districts. The Grand Canal at Venice has overflowed into the Piazza St Mark, submerging it to the depth of two feet. Paris, October 22 The Grand Duke Vladimir, on arriving in this city today, received the following despatch from the Czar, who is at Darmstadt: """"We are enjoying well-earned rest under the hospital roof of the Tyrants of Hesse."""" (Signed) Nikolai. The French newspapers assert that this telegram throws valuable light upon the condition of the Czar's spirit and the newspapers add that it proves his brain is not taunted by grave considerations after talking with Emperor William of Germany at Wiesbaden. Peking, October 22 An American syndicate will advance 30,000,000 taels for the construction of the Hankow-Peking Railroad. The line will be 700 miles long and will cross 27 rivers, including the Whang Ho, all of which will be bridged. The entire works will be transferred to the syndicate, but the shares of the Company will ostensibly be held by China. Sydney, N.S."
"THE SMITHFIELD SHOW: Details of Leading Markets The Putchers' Boycott Canadians at Glasgow (From our own correspondent) Liverpool, December 11 With fierce gales off the land and off the sea, with torrential showers, hail and rain almost daily, we have had a rough time of it during the past week. Business has not benefited thereby; quite the contrary. Our country markets have been filling up with cattle and sheep in anticipation of the Christmas demand, while the usual attractive shows and sales of Christmas fat stock have kept many buyers away from Birkenhead, who will, however, probably find their way back after the festive season is over. While the country demand has thus been cut off to a considerable extent, our London customers have been buying pretty strong, the supplies at Deptford for the past ten days having been below the average. The worst of this London trade, however, is they want to buy all our choice beef, and when they get served, there is some difficulty in selling out the secondary and third class bodies left. Still, things keep moving along, and salesmen would not feel comfortable if they had nothing to grumble about."
"B, November 6 Information from reliable sources says that out of eight ships off Kamouroska yesterday two are missing, supposed to have lost their anchors or run for Quebec. Two schooners at the Brandy Pots broke their chains and went adrift. The old wreck of the Margaret M, which was lying about twenty yards from the house of Mr. Puize at this wharf, was washed alongside of the house, and quite likely this, with the help of some fifty men, is what saved the building. The steamer Union had a very narrow escape from being wrecked while lying at the wharf at Eboulements. The passengers were all landed at the commencement of the gale, but the cargo was more or less damaged by the rolling of the boat and the seas shipped. One schooner is aground at the wharf. WHARVES SWEPT AWAY; Trois Pistoles, Q, November 6 We suffered much damage here by the rise of water. Three yachts were partly destroyed and a schooner damaged."
"WHARVES SWEPT AWAY; Trois Pistoles, Q, November 6 We suffered much damage here by the rise of water. Three yachts were partly destroyed and a schooner damaged. The wharf is nearly all destroyed; all that part made of stone and sand has been swept away, and the bridge and a lot of wood washed off. The loss is estimated at between $20,000 and $30,000. Green Island, Que, November 6 A heavy wind and snowstorm visited this place yesterday. Up till this morning about two feet had fallen. No casualties are reported. AT LITTLE METIS; Little Metis, November 6 A most severe snow and windstorm visited this coast yesterday, clearing everything in its way. All the houses along the shore have been carried off, also boats, fences, bridges, etc. The shore today is strewn with debris and household effects. The suffering will be intense from cold and hunger to those left destitute. L'Islet flooded; L'Islet, November 6 The damage by yesterday's storm is considerable, amounting to nearly $7,000."
"The suffering will be intense from cold and hunger to those left destitute. L'Islet flooded; L'Islet, November 6 The damage by yesterday's storm is considerable, amounting to nearly $7,000. All the principal streets and shops in all quarters of the village were flooded, some merchants losing heavily. All the wharves have been more or less damaged. The pavements in the streets have floated off. The whole village is in a very dilapidated condition. AT MATANE AND TADOUSAC; Matane, November 6 The storm of yesterday was the most severe that has been felt for many years past. The tide rose upwards of two feet over the ordinary November spring tides. Two parts of the Prince Bros. & Co. wharf were carried away and quite a number of deals floated out. Several persons here were obliged to abandon their houses. The damage will be about $3,000. Tadousac, Que, November 6 The wharf at this place and other property have been considerably damaged by yesterday's cyclone."
"The damage will be about $3,000. Tadousac, Que, November 6 The wharf at this place and other property have been considerably damaged by yesterday's cyclone. It is stated that there has not been so severe a storm for the past fifty years. The damage cannot be estimated at present. St. Thomas (Montmagny), November 6 The most severe snow and windstorm that has ever visited this town commenced yesterday afternoon and continued during the whole night. Considerable damage was done to the breakwater by the high tides. Ice is forming here very quickly. Car Rocs, Que, November 6 The steamer Champion, with five schooners in tow, bound for Quebec put in here for shelter last night. One of her tows was cast adrift. The market steamers Etoile and St. Louis, with about 200 passengers on board, had also to seek shelter here, a violent hurricane blowing. The tide rose about four feet above the normal spring tide mark, accompanied by a mild cyclone and snowstorm which lashed the waters into a fury. Part of the village was inundated; damage light."
"The tide rose about four feet above the normal spring tide mark, accompanied by a mild cyclone and snowstorm which lashed the waters into a fury. Part of the village was inundated; damage light. Two feet of snow had fallen this morning. Sleighing is excellent and the weather cold. FASSTIVA, LC, November 6 Yesterday afternoon, at a point about three and a half miles east of Bic station, on the Intercolonial railway, the road of the Intercolonial for a distance of about a hundred feet was washed away by the extraordinary high tide. The damage was luckily discovered before the eastbound express reached Bic, and it was stopped at the station. A special train was then brought from Campbellton, with the intention of having the passengers and mails from the express train carted across the dangerous section, it being evident that the track could not be made passable for many hours. Unfortunately, about a mile east of the first was another and far worse washout, the lower part of the road for about three hundred feet having been swept away, but there was nothing on the surface to denote that such was the case."
"Unfortunately, about a mile east of the first was another and far worse washout, the lower part of the road for about three hundred feet having been swept away, but there was nothing on the surface to denote that such was the case. The engines and two cars jolted over the place safely, but the remaining cars of the train careened into the river. A brakeman named Perrin and a telegraph repairer named Lefrere were injured, neither seriously. A gang of men immediately set about building a temporary trestle, while another gang bored the track inward at the western washout. About two this afternoon both places were fit to traverse, and the express train, after its long delay, pursued its way eastward in safety."
"A hurricane swept over the camp at Allen Allen hot today and did a great deal of damage. So great was the force of the gale that the gable roof of the barrack was blown down and smashed to pieces. Every building on the grounds was more or less damaged. Fortunately the soldiers now at Allen were attending divine service when the storm broke upon the camp and no one is reported to have been injured. The church in which the service was being held withstood the fury of the gale. A terrific gale prevailed all day in the English Channel. The Cunard Auroral, from New York, which arrived at Liverpool this morning, was unable to stop at Queenstown on account of the gales. The gale, which has been accompanied by snow and heavy rain during Saturday and today, has done much damage throughout the country. Vessels in the English and Irish Channel have been obliged to run for shelter. Vessels arriving at Queenstown report terrible weather on the Atlantic. The steamship Wetherby, from Newport, November 18, which has been towed into Queenstown by the steamship MoGarel, had her shaft bent in a gale of December 4."
"The steamship Wetherby, from Newport, November 18, which has been towed into Queenstown by the steamship MoGarel, had her shaft bent in a gale of December 4. Four days later the MoGarel commenced towing her, and while the latter was engaged at this work four hawsers were broken, the Wetherby herself was damaged before she arrived at Queenstown. Buildings have been unroofed at the Welsh seaport of Llanelli, and one David Bee was fatally injured by the roof above him falling while he was in bed. Along the Yorkshire coast there has been a severe snowstorm. Suspension of railway service owing to the snow is reported. Floods are reported in many parts of Derbyshire and many streets are under water in Matlock. In the Tees Valley damage amounting to thousands of dollars has been done by the high water, scores of cottages are flooded and a bridge has been partly demolished. There have been several narrow escapes from death. At Cambridge two girls were rushed beneath falling walls. One of them, named Kate Foster, was killed outright, the other injured and in a critical condition."

"GALES IN GREAT BRITAIN, Hurricane damage to shipping, LOSS OF LIFE ON LAND AND SEA, London, January 27 The wind blew a hurricane all last night. Much damage was done here. Many persons were injured. The glass roof of the Westminster Aquarium was demolished, causing a panic among the audience, in which several persons were hurt. A printing office in the Haymarket was unroofed and a boy killed. Many vessels were wrecked off the coast, and a large number of lives lost. Reports from all parts of the kingdom agree that the gale was one of almost unparalleled severity. At Hastings the seas dashed over the streets, making walking dangerous. At Monmouth, the Wye and Monnow Rivers overflowed and the highways were flooded, and Southampton and Eastbourne suffered severely. At Torquay there were many casualties. Trees were uprooted and many boats swamped. Shops on the Isle of Wight closed early on Saturday owing to the hurricane. At Newry many houses were unroofed.

The mail train between Durham and Darlington was twice stopped by the gale. The large Nokomis, Capt. Murphy, which sailed for Londonderry on January 10th for Baltimore, and which returned to Lough Foyle for shelter, parted her cables and was driven out to sea. It is feared the vessel and all hands have been lost. The iron chapel at Newcastle was demolished, and the roof falling killed a woman and two children. A heavy snowstorm raged in many places. There have been numerous marine casualties around the coast, the trisia reports having had a rough passage, with heavy gales and tremendous sea. The railway station at Elmswell was blown across the rails, blocking traffic for some time. London, January 24 seven bodies have been washed ashore at Hythe.

"Pennsylvania Clippings, """"Si Hantor, PA, January 20 The most devastating snowstorm in years hit last night and this city is stormbound. The snow blanketed telephone and telegraph wires and this morning the streets were impassable. One huge pole directly in front of the Western Union office was broken off short by the unusual strain and service entirely cut off. The storm also extended to the cities of Wilkes-Barre and Carbondale. A Holiday For Telegraph Operators, Kittatinny, NJ, January 20 The storm here has been the most disastrous in years. The telegraph service has never experienced such interruptions. All communication was badly interrupted. The Western Union office is entirely closed to customers and employees have a holiday. Patterson, NJ, January 20 This city yesterday found itself back in the late twenties in some respects. The heavy weight of wet snow on the hundreds of overhead wires that stretched over the principal streets pulled down scores of poles all over the town. Of the seven interurban lines in the city only two run any cars. The rest are hopelessly blocked by fallen poles and wires. New York, January 20 No traces of the snowstorm of Saturday night and yesterday morning, which played such havoc with wires, remained in the air at least today. After a beautiful moonlit night, clear and cold, the atmosphere was delightfully fresh and bracing this morning. It was not cold and the sun shone brightly. It was a pleasant winter's day in every respect save underfoot. The work of repairing the broken telephone and telegraph wires, which was begun yesterday as early as possible, continued through last night in accessible places and went on with renewed vigor this morning. The Minimum on the Jersey Coast, Exmouth, NJ, January 20 As far as can be ascertained there are no vessels ashore between here and Sandy Hook, although several have been seen about half a mile offshore. The rumor that a three-masted schooner was stranded a mile south of Point Pleasant City is erroneous. Asbury Park, NJ, January 20 The wires here are all down with the exception of those of the Electric Light Company. The surf has cut out the beach and undermined the bathing houses. Long Branch, NJ, January 20 The storm has wrought great damage along the New Jersey coast between Sandy Hook and Point Pleasant City. The surf cut into the bluff here and tore out the beach. Several houses were unroofed and signs and chimneys blown down. All telegraph and telephone wires are down and the coast cut off from communication with the railways. All trains are being run on signal and are behind time. A GENERALLY FAIR DAY, moderately cold and mild. Local snow fall today, Toronto, January 20, 11 p.m. The pressure is comparatively high along the St. Lawrence Valley and in the Southern states and below normal elsewhere.

Weather Moderate winds partly fair; comparatively mild; light local falls of snow. St. Lawrence Light to moderate winds; generally fair; moderately cold; light local falls of snow."
"B, April 9, St. John today experienced the worst April snowstorm it has known for thirty-four years. The streets were blocked and business largely suspended. The storm, which began about midnight Sunday, raged with unabated fury all day. The air was full of snow, which was whirled into drifts five and ten feet deep. The schools suffered severely, and the few scholars that turned out were sent home at the noon hour. Over sixteen inches of snow fell during the day and it was of that wet kind which stuck wherever it touched. All attempts to clear the sidewalks were abandoned towards nightfall as useless. Tonight it is colder with a high wind. The street railway did not have a car out, and the Bay of Fundy and Boston steamers did not leave their moorings. The Short Line railway did not send out any trains, but the other railroads are running fairly well on time. The storm was confined to a small area, being comparatively light at Fredericton and Moncton."
"B, February 10, Yesterday's heavy snowstorm blocked almost every branch railway in the province and seriously interfered with the trunk lines. To-night a furious gale is blowing in St. John and throughout this section of New Brunswick with the mercury down below zero. The snow is drifting into large piles and is filling up railway cuttings faster than the ploughs can be operated against it. A train which left Fredericton yesterday morning only reached here to-night, and between Fredericton and Woodstock several passenger trains are stalled by the snow. Reports from many parts of the province state that this last snowfall has practically put an end to operations in the lumber woods, the snow being too deep for hauling. There is much suffering in many districts, through the highways being impassable for teams, the food supply for both animals and man being very short. Despatches from St. Stephen to-night state that the Canadian Pacific railway branch to that town is totally blockaded and like reports have come in from St. Andrew's. So far the Intercolonial has got through much better than its great competitor. The Kent Northern railway management is trying to dig through twenty-seven miles of snow drifts."
"DISASTER AND DEATH: The Effects of Flood and Storm in Chile - New York, September 20. Advices from Valparaiso, Chile, give particulars of the disaster which occurred there on August 11. An artificial pond, eight hundred feet above the level of the city, burst, flooding the valley Yungar and several streets. The flood came down in an irresistible torrent, sweeping everything before it and bringing down wrecks and trunks of trees with it. The stream came rushing through the street San Juan de Dios in a wave twelve feet high. Shops were deluged and the contents destroyed. Houses were swept away and their inhabitants drowned or bruised to death. Fifty-seven persons lost their lives. The streets were impassable for a week after the disaster. The damage to property was at least $1,000,000. The pond belonged to a brewer named Nicholas Mena. Panama, September 26. Valparaiso advices of August 18 say the late storms and heavy rains have done much damage. From Serena south there is hardly a place which has not suffered. Houses have been unroofed or otherwise damaged, telegraph wires torn down, railway banks and bridges swept away, towns inundated and general havoc caused. Congress has voted $500,000 for the most pressing necessities of Valparaiso, but that sum is nothing compared with the millions of dollars damage which has been done. Copiapo was inundated and twenty-seven persons were drowned. Traffic on the railroad between Valparaiso and Santiago was suspended for a week. During the present winter Chilean freight vessels representing over 15,000 tons have been wrecked. In the early part of last week the weather for a couple of days was phenomenally hot. On Sunday morning a norther set in, and the Chilean barque Cristina Navarro came into collision with the Chilean barque Bilbina and both were wrecked and abandoned by the crews. The Chilean barque Maxima was carried on shore and broken up. The crew reached other vessels. The American barque Success was driven ashore and broken up. The French barque Etoile du Sud dragged down to the British barque Cambrian and both foundered. A portion of the crew of the Etoile du Sud jumped on board of the Cambrian, but, with one exception, they all perished. The British barque Glentile collided with the Chilean barque Vanora and was knocked to pieces. All of these vessels carried valuable cargoes. Several Chilean steamers were badly damaged.

"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, JANUARY 9, 1998 A3 THE BIG FREEZE Transportation falls victim to weather Freezing rain turns highways into rivers of slush and railway lines into sheets of ice AARON DERFEL The Gazette Most trains, planes and automobiles ground to a halt yesterday as the second ice storm in a week battered the Montreal region's transportation network. Freezing rain turned highways into rivers of slush and rail lines into sheets of ice. Many motorists chose to stay home rather than venture out in the treacherous weather. Major airlines canceled flights in and out of Montreal, bus trips were delayed by as much as 45 minutes and train service was disrupted. At Dorval Airport, hundreds of commuters sat forlornly in the food court for hours on end, waiting to catch one of the few flights out of the city. ""It's like Siberia out there!"" Taline Kabadjian, 38, said as she picked at a half-eaten pastry. Kabadjian, who lives in Nice, flew to Montreal last week for a family visit."
"Taline Kabadjian, 38, said as she picked at a half-eaten pastry. Kabadjian, who lives in Nice, flew to Montreal last week for a family visit. ""But I can't wait to go home,"" she said, tears streaming down her cheeks. ""I've done nothing here but stay indoors and watch TV."" Ben Yankson, 21, arrived at the airport from Calgary a day late and was lounging in the terminal for hours, hoping to be picked up by his girlfriend. ""The problem is I can't reach her by phone,"" Yankson said. ""I don't know where she is and I'm hoping she'll come and get me. I'm a patient guy, but this is too much,"" he added. The airlines canceled 255 flights in and out of Dorval, up from 200 on Wednesday even though the runways were clear. The ice storm forced Transport Quebec to close 30 highways for most of the day and 13 were still off-limits late last night. Montreal Island highways, however, remained open and work crews were busy de-icing them overnight."
"The ice storm forced Transport Quebec to close 30 highways for most of the day and 13 were still off-limits late last night. Montreal Island highways, however, remained open and work crews were busy de-icing them overnight. Via Rail canceled its train routes west of Toronto in both directions because of fallen debris on tracks. ""The bus drivers are being very careful on the road because of the icy conditions,"" officials said they expected some lines would stay shut this morning. ""This is probably the first time that service from Toronto to the east coast has been canceled in a single day,"" Via spokesman Malcolm Andrews said. Commuter-train service was also hampered. The Montreal-Rigaud line has been closed until further notice, while there will be no service between Dorion and Rigaud until Monday. The other commuter lines should run normally. West Island commuters who thought they'd get to work early yesterday morning by rushing for commuter train No. 10 had another think coming. After pulling into Beaconsfield station about 20 minutes late, the 7:42 a.m."
"West Island commuters who thought they'd get to work early yesterday morning by rushing for commuter train No. 10 had another think coming. After pulling into Beaconsfield station about 20 minutes late, the 7:42 a.m. Montreal-bound train ground to a halt one kilometer short of Dorval station, when live electrical wires were spotted on the track. As many as 400 passengers were then told to disembark and walk to Dorval, where they could board buses bound for the Lionel Groulx metro station. At the Montreal bus station, trips to New York and Boston were canceled, while passengers had to endure delays for up to 45 minutes on all other routes. ""The bus drivers are being very careful on the road because of the icy conditions,"" bus terminal official Patricia Papineau said. The Montreal South Shore Transit Corp. cut 40 of its rush hour bus routes in the afternoon, leaving commuters with only the 21 major ones to get home."
"The Montreal South Shore Transit Corp. cut 40 of its rush hour bus routes in the afternoon, leaving commuters with only the 21 major ones to get home. The transit system could no longer keep up after three days of blackouts at all three of its garages, which left only backup generators to provide power for lighting, vehicle-repair equipment and a few fuel pumps, communications director Raymond Allard said. The Sureté du Quebec reported fewer highway accidents than in normal weather conditions because most motorists chose to stay at home. ""The rush hour was quite calm,"" Constable Francois Dore said. ""Fewer and fewer people are taking to the road and we expect that to continue today."" Debbie Parkes and Claude Arpin of The Gazette contributed to this report. Storm bringing people together Kahnawake elders look on bright side LYNN MOORE The Gazette Gratitude for an ice storm that has walloped their region hard, knocking out power to about half a million South Shore residents, is about the last thing one might expect from residents."
"But Joe Deer, his wife, Josie Deer, and other elders of Kahnawake figure that the storm has provided a set of opportunities that might come once or twice a generation. ""It's getting the people back together and it reminds people of their relationship with other people,"" Joe Deer told visitors to his Kahnawake home yesterday. An estimated 60 to 70 percent of Kahnawake's homes and businesses were without power yesterday afternoon. Evidence of the enduring storm was inescapable in the region. 200 COTS READY In Chateauguay, ice-laden trees partially blocked some riverside roads while Longueuil officials warned motorists, especially truck drivers, to avoid secondary roads and low-hanging, ice-laden power lines. Kahnawake's emergency shelter provided about 300 suppers last night and 200 cots were at the ready to serve as beds. ""We are prepared,"" community-services committee member Rheena Diabo said. And word of the shelter had been spread. About 15,000 notices had been distributed, advising people of the shelter set up at the Knights of Columbus hall."
"And word of the shelter had been spread. About 15,000 notices had been distributed, advising people of the shelter set up at the Knights of Columbus hall. Local radio station K103, using an emergency generator, alerted residents to news of the shelter and conservation officers had traveled in trucks and all-terrain vehicles to outlying homes, offering those residents a lift into town. But about 55 elderly or infirm people who had no power or heat refused to leave their homes, Diabo said. ""They grew up during the Depression and take this in stride,"" she said. ""They are tough and they know what to do."" They do have wood-burning stoves and light sources, Diabo added. And authorities or family members check on them regularly, she said. Deer, who is pushing 76 and breaks out the ceremonial tobacco when visitors arrive at his home, understands the stand taken by his contemporaries. So does Kellyann Meloche, who turns 23 next week, and uses computers, cellular telephones and fax machines in her job as coordinator of emergency planning for the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake."
"So does Kellyann Meloche, who turns 23 next week, and uses computers, cellular telephones and fax machines in her job as coordinator of emergency planning for the Mohawk Council of Kahnawake. ""They (the community elders) have been through tough times. For them, this is not difficult. And they have wood stoves. Now everyone is gathering around the stoves in their homes and talking. They like it that their children and grandchildren can come and sit around the fire and talk about things,"" Meloche explained. Among the items on Meloche's agenda yesterday were meetings with other emergency workers and council members to determine whether a state of emergency should be declared in Kahnawake. Another item was what the community's response would be to any possible offers of assistance from the Canadian Forces. It was a topic that Meloche approached gingerly yesterday. (During the 1990 Oka crisis, emotions ran high as armed Mohawks blocked the Mercier Bridge in solidarity with Mohawks in Kanesatake locked in a 78-day standoff against provincial police and the army.) ""These are certainly different circumstances,"" Meloche said."
"""These are certainly different circumstances,"" Meloche said. ""I know that a lot of people have put '90 in the past. For instance, we have got cots (for Kahnawake's shelter) from the Red Cross and there was a time in '90 when it refused to come in here because they deemed Kahnawake a war zone. But now we are working with them."" Damage from ice will be most costly GEOFF BAKER The Gazette A senior insurance official now says the ice storm that has ravaged southern Quebec this week will cost more to fix than any other winter weather disaster in Canadian history. ""I think this is definitely the worst storm where insurance was involved in terms of winter storms,"" said Raymond Medza, general manager for the Quebec region of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. Medza said that from the initial reports he's been getting, the cost of storm damage should rise well into the tens of millions of dollars when his umbrella association, which counts about 140 insurers in Quebec, starts getting financial estimates from members next week. Costly winter storms are unusual, he said, since the biggest inconveniences are usually limited to traffic chaos and not physical damage."
"Costly winter storms are unusual, he said, since the biggest inconveniences are usually limited to traffic chaos and not physical damage. The insurance bureau began tracking storm costs after the July 14, 1987, flood in Montreal that resulted in payouts of about $70 million. Financial damage from storms before that would have trouble cracking today's Top-50 list because of inflation and Medza said none of the winter ones - including Montreal's so-called ""storm of the century"" in March 1971 - come even close to what this week's will cost. ""I was in this same office I'm in now back in 1971 and I was stranded here for two days,"" he said of the storm that dropped 47 centimeters of snow in Montreal on March 3 and 4 of that year. ""We actually had a pretty good time here. While the streets were blocked and you couldn't go anywhere, you didn't have power failures or tree branches crashing down on cars and homes."" The most expensive winter storm recorded in Canada from an insurance perspective was a March 1991 tornado that tore through Sarnia, Ont., and caused $25 million worth of insurable damage."
"The most expensive winter storm recorded in Canada from an insurance perspective was a March 1991 tornado that tore through Sarnia, Ont., and caused $25 million worth of insurable damage. None of Montreal's previous ice storms made the insurance bureau's list of the most costly Canadian natural disasters. ""Two people who work with me had tree branches crash through their roofs,"" Medza said the heaviest storm damage occurs during the summer months, when high winds can cause tornadoes and excessive rain brings sewer backups and floods homes. Of the 48 most costly Canadian storms, 31 of them occurred during the months of July and August. But it was on Sept. 7, 1991, that a severe hail storm rained down on the city of Calgary, causing $342 million in insurable damage to homes and cars - the highest total recorded by any natural disaster in Canada's history.

The same weather system that has dumped more than 50 millimeters - and counting - of icy precipitation on southwestern Quebec this week has also wreaked havoc on eastern Ontario and several U.S. states. More than 200,000 Ontario Hydro customers in the areas of Ottawa, Kingston and Cornwall were left without power yesterday, and officials said it may be days before service is re-established. ""It's difficult to tell how long this is going to take, the weather is really working against us,"" said Ontario Hydro spokesman Al Manchee."
"""It's difficult to tell how long this is going to take, the weather is really working against us,"" said Ontario Hydro spokesman Al Manchee. ""It could be a matter of hours for some and a matter of days for others."" In Ottawa, more than 30,000 of the 110,000 Hydro customers in the city were without power yesterday morning, and the storm was again blamed for wiping out progress made earlier in the week. ""We're right back in the thick of things now,"" Hydro spokesman Dan Ralph said. City officials declared a state of emergency, and Ralph said it will be at least another 24 hours before the damage is repaired. The weather and Ottawa airport delays have forced Prime Minister Jean Chretien and the provincial premiers to postpone from Saturday to Sunday their departure on a trade mission to Latin America. While storm-struck people in Ottawa and Montreal scramble to find flashlights and friends with electricity, people living in the surrounding countryside are facing other challenges, like helping their animals survive and dealing with isolation."
"While storm-struck people in Ottawa and Montreal scramble to find flashlights and friends with electricity, people living in the surrounding countryside are facing other challenges, like helping their animals survive and dealing with isolation. At the Claire farmhouse in Vankleek Hill, Ont., the phone was ringing off the hook - just about the only appliance that is still working since the ice storm hit. ""No, I don't have a generator, I need a generator,"" Lorie Claire explained to a fellow dairy farmer on the other end of the line. ""We've been out since Monday. Oh God, it's terrible.""

Be discreet about your emergency plans; inform your neighbor/family where you will be staying and the telephone number where you can be reached. Indicate to your neighbor approximate times you will be passing by to verify your abandoned home. If possible, leave your neighbor a house key so they can make occasional verifications inside your home. Turn off all appliances so that your system will not be overloaded when electricity is re-activated. Giving your home that lived-in look: Inquire if your neighbor can park a car in your driveway. Ask your neighbor to make occasional verifications inside your home. Make sure all newspapers and mail are removed from the mailbox."

Mount Royal ravaged People ignore danger to visit the 'beautiful' mountain MICHELLE IALONDE The Gazette Standing in a branch-littered clearing on Mount Royal yesterday afternoon and looking up at the ice-glazed trees was like watching fireworks in reverse: The silver explosions would start, static in the sky, then a terrible crack, and a spectacular crash to the ground. Dozens of people were on the mountain yesterday, despite a city directive that all city parks are closed because of the danger of falling trees and branches. Nowhere was the damage as heavy as on Mount Royal, because of its height and exposure to the wind. Parks department superintendent Jean-Jacques Linscourt estimated yesterday that a quarter of the trees in Mount Royal Park might have to be cut down because of the terrible damage caused by this week's ice storm."
"Parks department superintendent Jean-Jacques Linscourt estimated yesterday that a quarter of the trees in Mount Royal Park might have to be cut down because of the terrible damage caused by this week's ice storm. COULD LOSE ONE-QUARTER ""A visual estimation leads us to believe that we could lose 25 percent of the trees in Mount Royal Park,"" parks department spokesman Edith Pariseau said, adding that the cost of the damage has yet to be tallied. She said the estimate was very rough and that parks officials were so busy dealing with emergencies yesterday that they could not take accurate stock of damage on the mountain. Mount Royal is a symbol of Montreal and one of its tourism jewels, with more than 3 million visitors a year. That kind of traffic, many of whom are skiers, mountain-bikers and hikers, makes the park's natural forest vulnerable at any time. But the trees on Mount Royal have taken the worst beating from the ice storm mainly because the mountain is 233 meters high, leaving the trees exposed to constant buffeting from the winds."
"But the trees on Mount Royal have taken the worst beating from the ice storm mainly because the mountain is 233 meters high, leaving the trees exposed to constant buffeting from the winds. Those winds were whipping up at about 4:30 yesterday afternoon as Armand Acedevo brought his two daughters, 4 and 9 years old, down from a careful walk on the mountain. ""I went in the clearings, where there were no trees above us. We just came to look at it, it's so beautiful,"" Acedevo said. Mount Royal Park, along with the city's 715 other parks, was officially closed by decree of the city's emergency-measures committee yesterday. Pariseau said it's impossible to put fences up around all the parks, but police can order pedestrians out and the city accepts no responsibility for injuries caused by falling branches. A length of police tape, along with a more effective clump of fallen branches, blocked the path up from Park Ave, but that didn't stop dozens of mountain enthusiasts and their dogs from taking their chances among the falling timber yesterday. In fact, many of those hiking on the mountain in the afternoon had no idea the park was officially closed."
"In fact, many of those hiking on the mountain in the afternoon had no idea the park was officially closed. Jason Cohen and Luc Lavoie emerged from a dense canopy of trees, cameras in hand. ""We are taking disaster shots; we took photos of the same trees last fall and they were so beautiful,"" Cohen said. Sean McCutcheon was walking his two dogs on the mountain yesterday as he does every day. The crashing all around him did not seem to faze him, although one of his dogs was obviously skittish. CALCULATED RISK ""Nobody stops me. I come here every day. I love these trees. I love this forest,"" he said. He said he had a couple of favorite old trees he wanted to check on, to see how they were doing, and was willing to take a ""calculated risk"" to do that. He said he was being careful not to walk directly under the trees, and listened carefully for that telltale, warning crack. Paul Richardt, strolling with a companion as night fell on Mount Royal, said it was painful to see the trees breaking."
"Paul Richardt, strolling with a companion as night fell on Mount Royal, said it was painful to see the trees breaking. ""There are emotions; it's not just trees. They are living things and it's hard to watch this, I find,"" he said. About 20,000 of the city's trees have been damaged so far by the storm. Stadium readied for Stones Big O maintenance workers check roof, remove ice, snow KATHRYN GREENAWAY The Gazette Mick Jagger's throat isn't the only thing that needs to be clear if the Rolling Stones are going to play the Olympic Stadium Sunday night. A crew of around 30 Olympic Stadium maintenance workers has been visiting the roof on a daily basis to chip away any accumulated snow or ice. Down below, meanwhile, the stage set is ready and plans have been laid to remove snow and ice from the ramps, walkways, and entryways to the massive building. MEASURED FOR SAGGING Every day the tension of the cables holding up the stadium's roof is measured with a specially designed instrument to make sure no part of the roof is sagging under a dangerous strain."
"MEASURED FOR SAGGING Every day the tension of the cables holding up the stadium's roof is measured with a specially designed instrument to make sure no part of the roof is sagging under a dangerous strain. As of yesterday, all the cables registered well under the danger mark. ""It's hard to say how long (the cleanup process) will take because this is an exceptional situation which involves many variables,"" Olympic Installations Board spokesman Francine Saucier said yesterday. ""We have to consider things like how strong the wind is blowing, how much more frozen rain is still on the way, or will the rain turn to snow?"" None of the workmen were available for comment yesterday, but Saucier said they use nothing fancier than plastic shovels to get rid of ice on the roof. No chemicals, just shovels with edges rounded to prevent perforating the flexible roof. Is it dangerous work? ""Men are working on a slanted, flexible surface which is slippery with ice. So far things are going well,"" Saucier said."
"Residents of rain-weary Cape Breton will have to wait a few more days before the province determines if flooded basements and businesses qualify for financial assistance. Jamie Muir, the minister responsible for emergency measures, took a first-hand look yesterday at some of the areas hardest hit when a month's worth of rain soaked the island last week. After a tour that included collapsed culverts on the outskirts of Sydney, a heavily damaged basement in the town of Dominion, and a swamped store in Glace Bay, the minister said it will take days to place a dollar figure on the damage. ""We've seen damage in all areas,"" said Muir, a Truro resident who experienced the massive flooding that took place there a few years ago. Muir said there was a ""significant amount of damage,"" but didn't speculate on the total cost. ""Each case is different,"" he said. MUST TALLY DAMAGE While the province has a disaster-relief plan, Muir said individual homeowners will have to tally the damage and apply for assistance. The policy, which carries a $1,000 deductible, covers uninsurable damage to homes and small businesses up to $50,000."
"The policy, which carries a $1,000 deductible, covers uninsurable damage to homes and small businesses up to $50,000. The overall damage must also trigger a national relief policy before the provincial plan kicks in. In Nova Scotia, that means roughly one dollar per capita, or $942,000, worth of damage must be incurred in any area of the province before relief is offered. ""There are a number of factors and it doesn't take a long while to straighten out once things dry out,"" he said. ""But until the water goes down and people get things dried out, it's pretty difficult to make an assessment."" BRIDGE REPLACED Muir added that the province is already footing the bill for repairs to a culvert eaten away by a rushing brook in the Floral Heights subdivision near Sydney. Yesterday, crews replaced a walking bridge that was the only way in or out for about 150 families, with a 26-metre span. The new bridge was expected to be operating after midnight, emergency measures spokesman Debbie Rudderham said. Weather forecasters weren't offering any immediate relief from the wet weather."
"The warm weather (and no rain) in the last few days has helped, but the river is still a few feet above normal,' she added. Catherine Morsink, whose backyard in Pierrefonds is underwater, said she's no longer worried about her house being flooded. 'The landing is underwater, but the house is safe,' she said. 'It was much worse about 10 years ago. It looks like the river is about 40 feet wider, but our sump pumps aren't going like they were earlier this week.' 'We had them running every 10 or 15 minutes, but even when they were running I was more concerned about the pumps being overworked than I was about being flooded,' Morsink said. Climate change blamed as insurance payouts increase Insurance claims relating to water damage are the fastest-growing category of all claims in Canada. But those payouts involve water damage caused mainly by flash storms in summer that result in sewer backups and basement flooding. Quebec insurers paid out more than $500 million in water-related claims in 2005-06, said Jack Chadirdjian, director of public affairs for the Quebec branch of the Insurance Bureau of Canada."
"Quebec insurers paid out more than $500 million in water-related claims in 2005-06, said Jack Chadirdjian, director of public affairs for the Quebec branch of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. That amount represents 45 per cent of $1.1 billion in payouts overall, he noted. 'The 45-per-cent figure is significant because water-related payouts represented only 21 per cent of the total as recently as 2001-02,' he said. 'It's because of climate change,' Chadirdjian said. 'Not just more rain,' he said, 'but more rain compressed into shorter periods of time'—like the 100 millimetres (about four inches) of rain that fell in one hour in Montreal in July 1987. The problem of water damage is particularly acute in the Montreal area, where aging infrastructure can't cope with heavy storms. Residential home insurance policies do not cover water damage as a routine general risk. People who want to be insured for water damage have to purchase special water-damage riders, also known as endorsements or supplements. They generally cost about $50."
"Residential home insurance policies do not cover water damage as a routine general risk. People who want to be insured for water damage have to purchase special water-damage riders, also known as endorsements or supplements. They generally cost about $50. The difference between water damage caused by sewer backup and water damage caused by floods isn't always clear, Chadirdjian said. Sometimes, people who live blocks away from a shoreline where there has been flooding will have sewer backup without any evidence of invading surface floodwater. Inspectors are very astute at being able to identify the factors, he said. Some of which means you can pick up beef bourguignon, cassoulet and lacquered duck on your way home and be eating dinner 15 minutes later.

"But hopefully the water won't Flood-relief schemes differ among provinces TAXPAYERS BEAR FINANCIAL BURDEN Quebec offers $100,000 maximum; Ontario doubles funds raised by committee Residential property owners can't buy flood insurance in Quebec—or in most of North America, for that matter. But they can, and do, apply for government financial aid after floods—and no more so in Canada than in Quebec, where the provincial compensation plan is worth as much as $100,000. The kind of flood-relief compensation provincial governments offer residential property owners varies widely. But the comparison of Quebec with Ontario is interesting for what it says about political philosophies in the two provinces—and the bottom line for taxpayers."

Troops vs floods Soldiers line banks of Yangtze REUTER BEIJING - Chinese troops lined the banks of the mighty Yangtze River yesterday and factories deployed workers to plug leaks in embankments to prevent the rain-swollen river from bursting its banks, officials said. ""The Yangtze is now above the level at which the river broke through its banks in 1931,"" said an official of the Flood Control Headquarters in the huge industrial city of Wuhan, capital of central Hubei province. ""We are guarding the banks with our lives,"" he said. ""This is a critical moment."" Along the river, Asia's longest, troops, paramilitary police, and workers mounted a round-the-clock watch on embankments holding in the rain-swollen waters in check. More than 600,000 people were deployed at intervals of three people every 30 feet and with one person every three feet on most dangerous segments, the official said."
"More than 600,000 people were deployed at intervals of three people every 30 feet and with one person every three feet on most dangerous segments, the official said. Factory workers have been ordered to watch the dikes for cracks and to fill any holes burrowed into the vital embankments by snakes and rats, factory officials said from Wuhan. ""This is the second-highest water level of the Yangtze since records were kept 131 years ago,"" one official said. Rain was still falling along the upper reaches, posing a future threat, the flood-control official said. In central Hunan province, where floods have killed 195 people in the last few days, officials said torrential rains have stopped and the water level in China's largest freshwater lake, the Dongting, is falling from an all-time high, but remains above the danger level. Floods across a belt of central and southern provinces have killed at least 870 people in China this year and left millions homeless or stranded. About 8 million soldiers, police, students of military academies and civilians have been fighting the floods along the Yangtze river in Hunan and Hubei for days."

Most of the details of that package are expected to be revealed by Friday. The package will include $2,500 in emergency aid for people who will be out of their home for two weeks or more. Those hit by the floods are also expected to get reimbursed for a higher portion of their lost home and furnishings. Small businesses are usually eligible for aid equaling half the cost of replacing equipment and essential inventory, up to $75,000, but that also is expected to be increased this time. Many medium-sized firms might suffer more, however, since they are responsible for their own flood insurance, an option which not all buy."
"Many medium-sized firms might suffer more, however, since they are responsible for their own flood insurance, an option which not all buy. Francois Renault, a Boreale Assurances official in Chicoutimi as part of the company's emergency team, said it appears fewer than one in 10 commercial clients in the area had flood insurance. Some of the region's biggest companies said they expect to file multimillion-dollar claims for damages and lost business from closings. Ironically, many of the major companies who will lose production are suffering from a lack of water, after water-service facilities were washed away. The Stone-Consolidated Corp. newsprint mill at La Baie saw its water supply on the Ha! Ha! River ripped away, closing the plant for what is expected to be four to six weeks. ""The pipes and pumping station and all just plain washed away,"" said company spokesman Denise Dallaire. The plant will lay off its 800 employees and lose production of more than $500,000 of newsprint per day. The losses still haven't been determined, but Dallaire said it will be more than $10 million."

Rain keeps people of Jonquiere on edge JONATHON GATEHOUSE THE GAZETTE JONQUIERE - Weary and flood-shocked residents of Jonquiere were left in the dark again last night, after a new storm hit the community, knocking out power for several thousand people downtown. The heavy rains, which dumped more than 10 millimeters in less than half an hour, weren't expected to significantly affect the still-swollen Riviere aux Sables, but they were an unwelcome reminder of the weather-driven devastation of the last few days. Municipal authorities said they expected power would be restored by midnight."
"Municipal authorities said they expected power would be restored by midnight. For most of yesterday, however, bright sunshine and warm temperatures attracted hundreds of curious onlookers to the city's downtown. As the river's waters slowly receded, it was an opportunity to survey the damage caused by the worst floods in Jonquiere's history. ""It's a phenomenon of nature and we can't do anything about it,"" said resident Simon Hebert. ""We're powerless in the face of this."" Hebert was marveling at the remains of a downtown apartment complex on the river's heavily eroded east bank. One building tumbled into the frothing waters 20 meters below on Sunday afternoon. The only trace of the structure are its front balconies and one wildly tilted living room that dangles over the cliff face. A portrait of Christ hangs on the wall above a tartan sofa, and vertical blinds still cover the picture window.

"Two neighboring apartment buildings in the St. Jean Baptiste complex are perched precariously on rapidly disappearing foundations, large parts of their facades lost in the seething brown waters. A short distance downriver, the Soucy St. dam lies high and dry, covered with logs and other debris. When the dam refused to burst beneath the pressure of the waters, the river chose the path of least resistance and carved a new bed out of the earthen bank, bypassing the old concrete structure. A volunteer worker guarding access to the river's edge said the curious crowds drawn to the disaster scene have created a problem for the city. ""During the first couple of days, people were ignoring the security perimeters,"" he said. ""But now it's OK. After they saw the force of the water, they became a lot more respectful."" One kilometer farther downstream are the remains of a new 4-megawatt dam and power-generating plant owned by the city of Jonquiere.

"The surging waters again jumped their banks leaving a second dam without purpose. The structure was built at a cost of $6 million and had been in service for less than a month. In an interview, Jonquiere Mayor Marcel Martel estimated the cost of repairs would easily exceed $2.5 million. He said even though the province has already agreed to help with the reconstruction, the city stands to lose $800,000 in revenue it hoped to earn from the sale of the electricity. Despite the abundant evidence of the destructive power of nature, not all onlookers were awestruck. Chantal Lavoie, visiting from Quebec City, said she was slightly disappointed.

JONATHON GATEHOUSE THE GAZETTE CHICOUTIMI - Mayor Ulrich Blackburn is calling for an investigation of allegations that the Quebec government and local industries mismanaged dams controlling the region's water levels, and are largely responsible for last weekend's devastating floods. At a press conference yesterday, Blackburn responded to the anger of area residents, and asked why water levels in Lac Kenogami, which feeds the overflowing Chicoutimi and Aux Sables rivers, were kept so high before last week's torrential rains. ""In the 135 years of Chicoutimi's history, this is the worst flooding we've ever seen,"" Blackburn said. ""And before we didn't have the dams, we just Heavy-rain warnings sent: weather agency MONIQUE BEAUDIN THE GAZETTE Environment Canada gave ample warning last week of the heavy rains that led to destructive flooding in the Saguenay region, a spokesman for the national weather agency said yesterday.

"""We are very, very proud of the work that we did,"" said Pierre Ducharme, head of meteorology at Environment Canada's Montreal office. ""It would be hard to get more accurate predictions than what we had."" The agency reviewed its weekend procedures to see how it handled predicting the heavy rainfall that battered the Saguenay area. The Montreal office has a severe-weather team that watches for heavy rains, tornados and other extreme weather conditions. It sent out a first warning of heavy rain at 2:10 p.m. Thursday, saying there could be accumulations of more than 50 mm of rain. A second warning was issued on Friday. ""The warnings we sent out almost perfectly match the areas hit by heavy rainfall,"" Ducharme said. But Environment Canada didn't warn anyone about flooding because ""that's not our job,"" he said. ""Once we predict heavy rains, it's up to the dam-owner or a homeowner to make sure they can deal with it."""
"THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SATURDAY, JULY 31, 1993 A9 Flooding, tornadoes sweep across Prairies 14-year-old becomes first casualty CANADIAN PRESS SOUTHAM NEWS WINNIPEG - A police diving team continued its search yesterday for the body of Shahid Husain, a 14-year-old boy who waded into a flooded creek in a Winnipeg suburb. And a series of tornadoes swept across north central Alberta late Thursday and early yesterday morning, causing damage to farms and silos. Husain became the first casualty of flooding in the Winnipeg area when he became stuck in the mud and was swept away by the strong current Thursday. ""We have what is normally a quiet little creek that has now become a raging river,"" said Winnipeg police Sgt. Paul Johnson. It will be some time before streams like the one Husain disappeared in return to normal levels. Usually less than knee-deep in midsummer, Sturgeon Creek is now many metres deep and almost 10 times wider than normal at the spot the youth entered."
"Usually less than knee-deep in midsummer, Sturgeon Creek is now many metres deep and almost 10 times wider than normal at the spot the youth entered. The swollen Red River, which runs through the city, is expected to crest in the next few days but a floodway will prevent the river from flooding its banks. In all, more than 200 millimetres of rain have fallen in some areas. In Alberta, the 90-kilometre corridor from Holden to Vegreville to St. Paul was the scene of most of the serious damage. One twister followed a path that started 55 kilometres east of Edmonton and tracked northeast. The other hit just east of Falun, a village 75 kilometres southwest of Edmonton. The Sportsman Motor Inn and an Alberta Wheat Pool grain elevator in Smoky Lake, about 70 km northeast of Edmonton, were extensively damaged by another tornado early yesterday morning. Tim Aldie of Environment Canada said yet another tornado may have tracked up toward the Lac La Biche - Fort McMurray area. Wind speed in the Conklin area was clocked at 144 km/h."
"Tim Aldie of Environment Canada said yet another tornado may have tracked up toward the Lac La Biche - Fort McMurray area. Wind speed in the Conklin area was clocked at 144 km/h. But the tornado that touched down northwest of the town of Holden was by far the most devastating, said Graham Blundell of Alberta Disaster Assistance. Several properties were levelled or severely damaged and two people were injured when the tornado touched down. Feed containers holding thousands of bushels of grain were thrown about in the maelstrom. One crushed a three-tonne truck. Insulation and debris was strewn in the branches of the trees that still stood. Disaster Assistance officials were surveying damage yesterday. West central Saskatchewan was also hit hard by severe weather from the same system. There, the wind uprooted trees, damaged homes and farms and pounded crops.

THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 3, 2006 Rail, winds storm into town TREES TOPPLED Two deaths blamed on slick roadway JAN RAVENSBERGEN THE GAZETTE Toppled trees, crushed cars, streets clogged with debris-these were scenes across Montreal Island yesterday that rekindled memories of the January 1998 ice storm. But the damage inflicted by Friday evening's freezing rain, and the violent winds that followed, was on a much less disastrous scale. The stormy weather was a factor in an accident about 40 kilometres east of Montreal that killed two people, police said. A driver and a passenger were killed late Friday in a head-on collision involving their vehicle and a large truck on a two-lane road in the town of St. Jean Baptiste, near Mont St. Hilaire. The road was slippery, police said. The freezing rain, working in tandem with heavy gusts of wind that swept through southern Quebec yesterday morning, created havoc on and off Montreal Island."
"Hilaire. The road was slippery, police said. The freezing rain, working in tandem with heavy gusts of wind that swept through southern Quebec yesterday morning, created havoc on and off Montreal Island. Reports of at least 200 road mishaps flooded in from across the Surete du Quebec's off-island territory, SQ Constable Marc Butz said. No one was killed and no major injuries were reported. ""There were many cases of cars losing control, leaving the road and ending up in the ditch-everywhere there were heavy winds,"" SQ Constable Manon Gaignard said. There were also many vehicle accidents in Montreal but no reports of any weather-related deaths or severe injuries, as well, Montreal police Constable Raphael Bergeron said last night. He said he could not estimate the number of fender-benders. The westerly winds at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport in Dorval were blowing steadily at 63 kilometres an hour at 6 a.m. yesterday, gusting to 76 kilometres an hour by 7 a.m., Environment Canada said.

Montrealers in residential neighbourhoods were left picking up the pieces, in many cases literally, often with the power out. In Notre Dame de Grace, a mature tree snapped off close to the ground and fell across Marcil Ave., shattering the rear window and damaging the trunk of Eric Longtin's BMW. The fallen tree completely blocked traffic near de Maisonneuve Blvd. A few blocks north of Longtin, several of his neighbours awoke with the same morning-after headache. Another mature tree, also at least 10 metres long, had been ripped out by its roots. That tight race to replace Klein SUPPORT SURGES Second-choice votes DEAN BENNETT CANADIAN PRESS Edmonton - Former Alberta finance minister Jim Dinning pulled away from his rivals in early vote returns in the race to replace Premier Ralph Klein, but appeared to fall short of the majority needed for a quick victory."
"It was a surprising leap in popularity for Stelmach compared to ground-roots and all. Police issued a warning early yesterday that wind-blown branches - and in some instances construction materials - made navigation of some roads hazardous. Montreal police Constable Olivier Lapointe urged motorists to be very careful. Shortly before noon, a green residential recycling box driven by the wind was spotted skittering across St Jacques St W near Cavendish Blvd, far from any residences. Today, Environment Canada is calling for cloudy conditions, a high of minus 1 C, and two to four centimetres of snow beginning late in the morning. Another two centimetres of snow is expected overnight tonight, with westerly winds of 20 kilometres an hour and a low of minus 5. The Weather Network forecasts about one centimetre of snow during today, with morning temperatures of minus 7 C, winds of five kilometres an hour and an evening low of minus 1 C. In eastern Ontario, about 33,000 homes and businesses remained without electricity last night after Friday's storms knocked out power and wreaked havoc on the roads."
"About half the customers without electricity were in the Vankleek Hill and Winchester areas. The storms were also blamed for a mudslide in the Durham region, east of Toronto. In the United States, thousands of people were without light and heat yesterday after the Midwest's first big snowstorm of the season. The storm was blamed for at least 11 deaths as it cut a swath from Texas to Michigan and then blew through the Northeast early yesterday. Canadian Press and Associated Press contributed to this report. With the first round of voting last week, when 97,690 party members across the province marked an X, Dinning was first with 30 per cent, four percentage points ahead of Morton and double the total of Stelmach. Although lacking the campaign war chest and headline-grabbing quotes of his rivals, the 55-year-old northern Alberta farmer from a rural constituency north of Edmonton made up for it with a down-home appeal to honour, integrity and common sense that garnered supporters on both sides of the rural-urban divide. Dinning had been organizing his leadership for some four years and was perceived as the front-runner since the start of the campaign."
"Dinning had been organizing his leadership for some four years and was perceived as the front-runner since the start of the campaign.

"C rainstorms cause widespread flooding, close roads, rail lines CANADIAN PRESS VANCOUVER More than three days of torrential rain in southwestern British Columbia forced families to evacuate their homes, destroyed buildings and caused millions of dollars in damage to highways and property. The most devastated area was the Fraser Valley east of Vancouver where hundreds of hectares of prime farmland were under water and the Trans-Canada Highway was washed out. Highways Minister Rita Johnston toured the area by helicopter yesterday and said flood victims will receive emergency help. Ministry officials said it will cost millions to repair washed-out roads and bridges. While water levels in the Fraser Valley began to recede last night, a Labrador helicopter from CFB Comox began rescuing about three dozen residents in the Sayward area of northeastern Vancouver Island. The evacuees were taken from their homes along the swollen Salmon River to a recreation centre in Sayward. In Abbotsford, dairy farmhand Dan Gilding, 25, saw a wall of water break over nearby railway tracks Saturday and made a run for it. ""The railway tracks broke and it came over the top like a river,"" he said."
"""The railway tracks broke and it came over the top like a river,"" he said. ""Everybody piled into pickups and got out of there."" More than 300 dairy cattle and 1,000 pigs had to be moved to higher ground along with area residents. Rain remained in the forecast until Thursday but the weather office said it will not be as heavy. That is good news for people who face flooded homes and farms or had to abandon their cars on impassable highways. On top of that, BC Rail couldn't operate to the Interior yesterday because of a washout near Whistler and another south of Lillooet. In some areas, about 200 millimetres of rain fell between Thursday night and yesterday enough to be over the top of an ankle-height rain shoe. The good news was that there were no reports of personal injury due directly to the flooding, although a passenger in a car that missed a curve drowned in a flooded creek. The bad news was that travel was disrupted and property damage may run into the millions. Fields were flooded and buildings damaged, basements swamped and highways blocked by mud and rock and, in some cases, underwater."

"In addition to banning political meetings, the authorities have resumed their old habit of cracking down on public protests. Earlier this month, police viciously attacked a group of women hunger strikers and their supporters in a Nairobi park. Several were badly beaten, including Wangari Maathai, 53, a prominent environmentalist and opposition supporter (but not one of the hunger strikers), who was knocked unconscious. The hunger strikers, who are calling for the release of their sons in prison on what they say are politically motivated treason charges, have since taken sanctuary in a church. That is in disappointing contrast to the authorities' tolerance of a massive anti-government rally in January that many hoped was the beginning of an official commitment to pluralism. Whatever the government's intentions, pressures for political change are building, internally and externally. Within Kenya, economic conditions seem to be worsening; unemployment is high, there is a drought, prices for major exports are weak and the vital tourism industry is suffering as crime increases.

As well, expectations of political change seem to be increasing. Meanwhile, external pressure continues from Western aid donors, who say they will suspend aid if Kenya fails to make political and economic reforms (such as cleaning up high-level corruption and instituting austerity measures). They have set an April deadline. A tide of democratization is sweeping Africa. It already is lapping at Kenya's shores.

"Some might say that, at last, thanks to Joe Clark, Bob Rae and Ovide Mercredi, this Canada Round is beginning to take on the character of its name.

A 12 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, MONDAY, MARCH 30, 1992 Famine and food riots begin as drought settles in southern Africa JONATHAN MANTHORPE SOUTHAM NEWS HARARE, Zimbabwe As the worst drought in more than 100 years settles its grip on the 85 million people of southern Africa, the first signs of serious famine and social breakdown are beginning to show. There are already reports of deaths from starvation and malnutrition-related diseases in a region that has been largely able to feed itself until now."
"There are already reports of deaths from starvation and malnutrition-related diseases in a region that has been largely able to feed itself until now. It is estimated that Africa south of the equator will have to import between 12 million and 15 million tons of food in the next 12 months. While the food can be obtained, there is serious doubt the region's transportation system can handle its distribution. And distributing the food will require a high degree of cooperation among countries more used to rivalries and jealousies. There are indications that there may be long-term consequences for the region's agriculture. Beef and dairy herds are dying or being slaughtered in large numbers because of lack of water and feed, and it will take many years to rebuild them. The drought follows a decade of poor rains and meteorologists speculate it may herald a semi-permanent climatic change. In Zambia and Zimbabwe, the drought will undoubtedly affect the government's plans to move away from quasi-socialist economies to free-market systems. Diplomats say they do not believe Zimbabwe's World Bank-sponsored economic adjustment program will survive the drought."
"In Zambia and Zimbabwe, the drought will undoubtedly affect the government's plans to move away from quasi-socialist economies to free-market systems. Diplomats say they do not believe Zimbabwe's World Bank-sponsored economic adjustment program will survive the drought. Already food shortages are having dramatic psychological effects on people used to plentiful and regular supplies of basic foodstuffs. Riot police were called out in central Harare last Thursday when hundreds of people besieged a supermarket rumored to have taken a shipment of sugar and maize flour, known as mealie meal, the region's staple. It was the third time riot police were called to quell food-seeking mobs in Zimbabwe in the last few weeks. The besieging of shops and mobbing of delivery trucks are almost daily occurrences in Zimbabwe, where President Robert Mugabe declared a national emergency three weeks ago. Delivery companies now call for police protection for their trucks as a matter of course. Already 2.3 million people, nearly a quarter of the country's population, require food aid. The country will need to import more than 2 million tons of maize in the coming 12 months following the almost total failure of this year's crop."
"The country will need to import more than 2 million tons of maize in the coming 12 months following the almost total failure of this year's crop. The country also needs 340,000 tons of wheat, 150,000 tons of rice and 160,000 tons of oilseed. Prices of most foodstuffs are rocketing as the government removes ceilings on payments to producers in an attempt to encourage production next season if the drought lifts. On Thursday, the Zimbabwe government announced a 25-percent increase in the price of gasoline. The price of milk jumped 34 percent this week and about 30 percent of the country's 60,000 dairy cows have been slaughtered because of low producer return and lack of water and feed. The situation is similar throughout the region. In South Africa, the Transvaal is a desert littered with stunted maize and sunflower plants shriveled by the sun and lack of rain. In this region alone, 2 million people are going to need food aid by April. In the Eastern Cape, the drought is worse than it has been in nearly 120 years and 2,000 farmers have gone bankrupt."
"In this region alone, 2 million people are going to need food aid by April. In the Eastern Cape, the drought is worse than it has been in nearly 120 years and 2,000 farmers have gone bankrupt. A traditional food exporter, South Africa will need to import 5 million tons of food this year. Namibia has lost its entire maize crop and, like Zambia, needs to import a million tons of maize. In Zambia, people have begun moving to the cities in search of food and water. Cholera is rife because water and sanitation facilities cannot cope. Tanzania has also been severely afflicted and on Wednesday the United Nations said that Kenya in East Africa faces famine. The two countries where starvation has been common for more than a decade, Mozambique and Angola, have had good rains and good crops. But famine in those countries has been caused mainly by prolonged civil wars and the problem will be getting food to the people who need it. The United Nations estimates 500,000 people face starvation in Mozambique's central provinces. Charles Bassett, the Canadian high commissioner in Zimbabwe, said Thursday that people are already dying in Zimbabwe as a result of malnutrition."
"The United Nations estimates 500,000 people face starvation in Mozambique's central provinces. Charles Bassett, the Canadian high commissioner in Zimbabwe, said Thursday that people are already dying in Zimbabwe as a result of malnutrition. And the worst is yet to come. The dry season is at its peak in July and August and the already critical water shortage will become dire, Bassett said. ""Already there are many communities that are 40 kilometres from the nearest water. It is going to be a massive task to take water to isolated communities,"" he said. The Zimbabwe government has a $40-million plan to buy 600 water tankers and to drill 2,600 holes, but it's uncertain the plan can be activated quickly enough. The crisis has led to corruption, profiteering and petty jealousies between government departments throughout the region. Hoarding of sugar, cooking oil and mealie meal is rife in Zimbabwe and the black market price of a 20-kilogram bag of meal has doubled beyond the reach of rural people."
"Hoarding of sugar, cooking oil and mealie meal is rife in Zimbabwe and the black market price of a 20-kilogram bag of meal has doubled beyond the reach of rural people. There are confirmed reports of customs officials at both the Beit-bridge crossing to South Africa and the Plumtree crossing to Botswana taking mealie meal from trucks entering Zimbabwe. In both cases, the officials claimed the trucks were overloaded. Zimbabwe's Grain Marketing Board and the country's National Railway are blaming each other for the slow distribution of maize being shipped in through South Africa. ""The shame of it is what we are seeing here is a tremendous amount of fighting among departments to take the lead,"" a source said. ""They seem to be more interested in taking the lead than in keeping people alive.""

An appeal to reduce power usage was issued in Ontario yesterday as its electrical consumption set a one-day record - 27,225 megawatts by 5 p.m., breaking the record of 26,160 megawatts on July 13, 2005. Marie Archambault, Hydro-Quebec spokesperson for exports, said the provincial power utility was selling about 100,000 kilowatts per hour to Ontario yesterday and the same amount is expected to be exported today. That's equivalent to the power needed for about 20,000 households. For New York state and New England, Hydro-Quebec is selling about 1,425 kilowatts per hour to each region.

BLOOMBERG NEWS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS REPORT mlsmartthegazette.canwest.com A driver was killed last night when Deadly storm ALANA COATES THE GAZETTE A violent thunderstorm swept through southern Quebec last night, cutting power to more than 450,000 homes and killing a Montreal man when a large tree fell on his car. The man was driving south on Cote des Neiges Rd. near Remembrance Rd. about 9:30 p.m. when the tree crushed his vehicle. He died instantly, Montreal police constable Anie Lemieux said. The storm was heaviest in Montreal and the Laurentians, although the Monteregie, Mauricie, and the Eastern Townships were also affected. As the storm moved southeast into Maine, all parts of Montreal were affected to some degree by power outages. About 78,000 households on Montreal Island were without electricity for periods ranging from a few minutes to several hours."
"As the storm moved southeast into Maine, all parts of Montreal were affected to some degree by power outages. About 78,000 households on Montreal Island were without electricity for periods ranging from a few minutes to several hours. The power outages were mainly the result of heavy winds, Hydro-Quebec spokesperson Marc-Brian Chamberland said. As branches toppled, lines would automatically shut off power to protect the system, he explained. Winds gusted to 100 kilometres an hour in parts of Montreal last night, causing trees to topple in several neighbourhoods, police said. Quebec's Public Security Department reported a small tornado near Lac Megantic, about 200 kilometres east of Montreal. Two men were slightly injured and there was heavy property damage, officials said.

This province's most costly winter storm was a raging blizzard that dumped 41.2 centimetres of snow on Montreal the night before the St. Patrick's Day parade in March 1993. Unlike this week's ice storm, the 1993 blizzard - which ran up an insurance bill of $18 million in Quebec, Eastern Ontario and Nova Scotia - seemed to end as soon as it came and the parade went ahead as scheduled the following day. Medza said the worst damage being caused this week is by tree branches falling on cars and homes."
"Medza said the worst damage being caused this week is by tree branches falling on cars and homes. ""Two people who work with me had tree branches crash through their roofs,"" he said. ""When you think that a roof of a house can cost $15,000, if this happens to 100 people, then you've already got a bill for $1.5 million."" Besides branches, Medza said the second-highest cost for insurers will probably be to replace food that has gone bad at restaurants and other commercial establishments because of the power outages. Pipe bursts should be the next most expensive item, he said, followed by roofs collapsing. One item that has yet to become an insurance factor is living expenses for people evacuated from their homes by civil authorities. Medza said there might be a handful of isolated cases, but he knows of no communities where people have been forced to leave for safety reasons. Denis Guertin, a spokesman for the Belair-Direct insurance company, has said that anyone finding a car or home damaged by falling objects - like tree branches or ice chunks - should telephone their broker or insurer immediately to make a claim."
"Guertin said it isn't necessary for photographs of the scene or damage to be taken since appraisers will do this, usually within three days of the first call. The appraisers must look at any damage before repairs are made, in order to determine how much money the insurance company will pay. Practically all comprehensive insurance packages offer compensation for damage caused by falling objects, or for car windshields and windows that break under the strain of ice scrapers. All deductibles must be taken into consideration first. So, if a person with a $400 windshield repair has a $500 deductible, he's out of luck.

At least 20 people sustained minor injuries, including some who were injured after falling off their motorbikes during the strong quake that accompanied the eruption. A chapel belonging to a congregation of Catholic nuns in the city of Hokeng was severely damaged. Mt. Lewotobi last erupted on June 29, 1904.

Jellyfish invasion One thousand swimmers were attacked by schools of jellyfish along the French Riviera during a weekend when high heat had driven many people to popular beach resorts. The colourful jellyfish, Pelagia noctiluca, is the most common variety in the area and was responsible for the stinging attacks. It's believed the sudden increase in the number of jellyfish was due to climatic warming, which triggered an increase in plankton food in the Mediterranean. Sino floods The death toll from the recent flooding along China's Yangtze River now stands at 240 people."
"Sino floods The death toll from the recent flooding along China's Yangtze River now stands at 240 people. The floods, which began in late June, have destroyed nearly a half a million homes and swamped 660,000 hectares of cropland. An estimated 1.84 million people have been evacuated from the affected areas. Siberian swarms Swarms of locusts migrating from Kazakhstan devoured large tracts of farmland in central Siberia in only a few days.

True sex appeal Zoologists have determined that good parenting and not inherent colourful plumage is what determines a sparrow's attractiveness to the opposite sex."
"Oh, in the total, these values are made up from the June schedules of farmers. They show an increase on the figure of last year of $1,000,000 in farm lands, of $500,000 in live stock, $200,000 in implements, and a little over $1,000,000 in buildings, or a total excess over the value of last year of $3,000,000 and of $511,000 over the average values of the five years' period. That certainly does not look as if the farmers of Ontario were suffering from the operation of the National Policy, and the enormous increase in the deposits in the Government and Post Office Savings banks, in the life companies and in the chartered banks are equally conclusive of the prosperity the farmers of Canada have enjoyed in recent years. United States journals, who in ridicule of the claims that the Canadian Northwest is less subject to the visits of the boreal blizzard than their own territories, declared that Winnipeg was the center of the ""banana belt"" of the continent, may read with profit the reports of the climatic condition that now prevail in the two regions. While in Minnesota, Dakota and Nebraska the railways are blocked with snow and occasionally at intervals with stalled and broken engines, along the line of the Canadian Pacific the trains are running on time, the weather is calm and fine, and the temperature from Winnipeg westward varies from 15 to 4 above zero. Bananas may not ripen to perfection north of the 49th parallel, but they will evidently do better than on the snowy wastes of Kansas and Dakota, the settlers on whose lands, harassed in winter by the blizzard, in summer by the cyclone, in harvest time by the red-legged grasshopper and at all times by the railway and elevator monopoly, could not do better than move up out of the cold to the more than equally fertile and less exposed Canadian territories where a cyclone cellar is a thing unknown and warm toes can be kept in everybody's boots."

In many parts of the United States and Canada subscriptions for the relief of the suffering people have been taken up, and considerable sums sent to the German Government for distribution, the receipt of which has been acknowledged in the Imperial Parliament. The German Society of Montreal have taken up the cause here, and the following letter will show that an effort which, it is to be hoped, will prove highly satisfactory, is to be made in this city to raise a fund for aiding in the work of alleviating the sufferings of the inhabitants of the inundated districts: To the Editor of the Gazette: Sir, We take the liberty of requesting space in your valuable sheet for the following short description of the disaster brought down upon large parts of the German Empire by the late floods, great inundations having occurred during the last months all over central Europe, bad harvests were experienced, and many farming districts reduced to little less than absolute poverty."
"In the Valley of the Rhine especially, where the fields have been immersed nearly one week, to the depth of several feet, the damage done is enormous. The retreating waves left hundreds of square miles thickly covered with mud and debris; thousands of trees were torn out by the roots and swept away; houses, by the hundred, were ruined, and many families rendered homeless and destitute, having lost everything in the vast deluge; and, saddest of all, hundreds of human lives were lost in noble attempts to save other lives and property from destruction. Several bridges in the flooded districts gave way before the great weight of those assembled on them, anxiously watching the rising of the water in the rivers, and few persons only could be saved from among the turbulent waves and mass of floating debris. THE LOSS OF LIFE is variously estimated to be from 1,700 to 3,000, and more than 30,000 persons are rendered homeless. The damage done to property, as far as can be ascertained, amounts to 80 millions of marks ($20,000,000). The condition of the inhabitants of the unhappy provinces is heartrending in the extreme."
"The damage done to property, as far as can be ascertained, amounts to 80 millions of marks ($20,000,000). The condition of the inhabitants of the unhappy provinces is heartrending in the extreme. Many families, having lost their supporters and the whole of their worldly possessions, are made entirely dependent upon the assistance afforded them by communities and Government, but in spite of the generous efforts made all over the Empire, to alleviate the wants of the sufferers, the means of the Government, as well as of private individuals, are found to be altogether inadequate to cope with the magnitude of the disaster. Thousands of dollars are required every day to provide shelter, warm clothing and food for the poor sufferers, and Germans all over the world are exerting themselves to assist those at home in raising the funds necessary for the work of charity. Their appeals have been crowned with success; large sums of money have been forwarded to the Imperial authorities and distributed by them in the flooded districts, and votes of thanks have been passed in the Reichstag to the generous contributors abroad."

"A PARALYZING TRANSITION, The great diminution in the exports of grain from this port is exciting much attention. In October 1880, we shipped nearly 13 million bushels; in the same month of 1881, less than 5 million. It would pay now to buy grain in Liverpool and ship it here if present prices continue. All the warehouses and elevators are full, and every canal boat and barge available is filled with grain awaiting the chance to ship. The vessels in port awaiting cargoes are getting tired, and some are leaving in ballast for other ports. The corner is expected to be broken shortly, however, and large shipments in November are hoped for. Immense stores of grain have accumulated along the railroads in the West, the report being that the corn in cribs on the Northwestern line exceeds by 3 million bushels the quantity there at this time last year. The shipping trade of the port is suffering in consequence of this state of things, as is shown by the fact that only 410 vessels arrived from foreign ports during October as compared with 683 in October last year. THE WATER FAMINE, The water famine scare has abated, thanks to the copious rains of the last few days. The fears of city people have been only prospective, but the suburbs really suffered for months. In some places, water had been bought at one dollar per barrel, a severe tax on the poor, and nearly all the cisterns and shallow wells having dried up, washing was fast becoming an expensive luxury. Water for drinking purposes of decent quality had become one of the real anxieties of life with many when the welcome rain came to their relief. New York City proper had only ten days' supply in hand when the rain came, so it was getting to be a near thing, and the problem of how 1,200,000 people were to be supplied when the rain came was looming up rather unpleasantly before the powers that be, absorbed as they are in the coming election. Even now the city is not out of the woods as the weather is mild enough to suggest a renewal of the drought. THE WISDOM OF THE FUTURE, It is manifest that the Croton River cannot solely be depended upon much longer, and it will be well for the authorities to begin to look up new sources of supply. It is simply a question of money, and there is plenty of that. Strange to say, the best watered city the writer has seen is in droughty Australia, where there are hardly any rivers and precious little rain, and no snow, but the necessities of the case stimulated the people, and the result is that Melbourne is plentifully supplied at all times from the mountains 40 miles away by aqueduct. The work was done at vast expense, but probably no city in the world is so fully and evenly supplied. The main streets have gutters three feet wide, which are kept constantly flooded and running, the water eventually reaching the sewers and the sea. The capital city of Australia, hardly 40 years old, with 300,000 people and a dozen parks, could teach some lessons to America and Europe well worth the learning.

The total receipts since January 1, 1882, comprise 341,106 bales domestic and 40,415 bales foreign, against 312,333 bales domestic and 26,173 bales foreign for the corresponding period of 1881. The sales for the week comprise 2,188,270 lbs of domestic fleece and pulled, and 309,500 lbs of foreign making the week's transactions total up to 2,557,770 lbs, against 2,186,050 and 2,547,270 lbs for the two previous weeks' transactions. The market has been more active than a week ago, the sales exceeding those by 371,720 lbs. This business has been done very quietly, and the tone of the market is one of disappointment from a dealer's standpoint. The main feature has been heavy transactions in territory wools, which have ruled rather lower from the highest prices. Better prices have been obtained for Ohio XX and above, the scarcity of choice lots of which is more marked, and prices in Ohio are very strong. The anxiety noted a week ago as to credits in the trade continues, and the market has been well stocked with rumors which are yet without any furious foundation. The London market, since the closing of the colonial quarterly sale, has been dull. The Australian mail of the week brought advices reporting that shearing was then (about September 4) in progress in the northern districts and parts of Riverina. A few lots of the new clip had also arrived in Melbourne. The continued drought has caused heavy losses of sheep in the western district of Victoria, and a large portion of the clip will be tender and badly grown.

"CHOI'S IN MANITOBA - Vegetation Retarded by Heat Drought - The Condition Generally Encouraging - WINNIPEG, July 10 The crop correspondents of the Manitoba Department of Agriculture are now sending in replies to the second series of questions addressed to them during the current season. A large number of reports have already been received at the department, many of which show that the dry weather of the past few weeks has been a serious drawback to the crops in this province, and that the bright prospects offered in the early part of June have not been fully realized. Coupled with the drought, the heat has been excessive and vegetation has consequently been much retarded. Considering both those serious drawbacks, the condition of the crops in most instances is encouraging. Though no rains have been general for some time, still a number of local showers fell which had the effect of preserving the crops from more serious results than otherwise would have been the case. Of the several crops, the wheat crop is generally at this date in the most flourishing condition. This is owing to the fact that it was sown at a very early date, and that the great bulk of the crop was put in on ground prepared last season. The Hennas Comes to Fleera - The first Fare of the Season Prince Edward Island Elections Precaution (from our own correspondent) Halifax, N.S., July 12 The steamer Hennas, ashore at Cape North, is now breaking up.

IS A remarkable experience of a Brooklyn Priest Taken for Dead, yet Fully Conscious Ottawa, July 12 The Rev. Father Smith, of the Society of Priests of Mercy, popularly known as the Fathers of Mercy, a native of Ottawa, left here for Brooklyn on Saturday after a visit to his mother and family. The reverend gentleman has had a unique experience recently. He had been seriously ill and fell into a trance which was taken for death and the news of his demise was wired to his family. While lying awaiting interment he fully realized the preparations that were going on around him, but was unable for a considerable time to signify that he was still living. Happily, however, he recovered and among others who called upon him to congratulate him was a brother priest who had been summoned from another city to preach his funeral sermon."
"Reports received from many points in Ontario indicate that fall wheat will be hardly an average crop, much of it having been winter killed. Spring wheat will, it is believed, be slightly over the average. Oats have not done well and will be short. If barley is a fair crop, it is all it will be. Hay is a failure. Peas are reported to be average. Roots and fruit are good, live is in many places but half a crop. The west makes a much better showing than the east, where a large area suffered from the long drought. Injuring every growing thing. In many cases farmers will have to purchase food. Fodder will have to be purchased for stock."

There were only 68,000 barrels made, against 61,208 barrels the previous week, and 130,000 barrels for the corresponding time in 1887. More mills are running this week, but still the production promises to go considerably under 100,000 barrels for the six days. There were nine mills in operation yesterday, which were milling about 14,000 barrels a day. Anchor ice, however, began to bother last night and before morning nearly every mill in operation was choked off. This difficulty was partially overcome later and the weather having moderated may not cause serious obstruction very long. Nevertheless, cold weather is long past due, and a hard freezing would doubtless cut off the greater part of the water supply. One mill is using steam power at present to enable it to run up to full capacity while in operation."

"R, mui thence, on the 24th November, to Montreal over respondents' line of railway. The appellants' pretension was that the fruit got damaged in the transit from St. John to Montreal, through respondents' employees' negligence and fault, by being overheated in heater cars in which the oranges had been placed to preserve them from frost. The court below dismissed the action on the ground that appellants' agent at St. John had requested that the oranges should be put in heater cars, and even paid additional freight for that purpose, that the least possible amount of heat that could be put to the heating apparatus of the cars was put by the employee attending to that service. It was contended by the appellants that the oranges were delivered to the respondents in the usual condition; and that they were damaged by heat while in respondents' possession. The respondents did not show that the damage was caused by a fortuitous event, or had arisen from a defect in the fruit itself, and, consequently, under article 1675 of the Civil Code, they were responsible for the loss."
"The respondents did not show that the damage was caused by a fortuitous event, or had arisen from a defect in the fruit itself, and, consequently, under article 1675 of the Civil Code, they were responsible for the loss. The goods were placed under the absolute control of the respondents, and they undertook to use heat to prevent them from freezing, for which they were paid, and respondents were bound to use heat in the same way as they were bound to perform their other duties as carriers, and with the same legal liability. They could only use heat to the extent to which they were authorized to do so, namely, to keep off the frost, and in going beyond that they were clearly responsible for the result. It was contended by the respondents that, as appellants' agent requested that the goods should be placed in heated cars, the damage ensuing by overheating was not due to any fault on the part of the company's officials, but to the deliberate choice of appellants' agent to have them carried in heated cars.

IN BOSTON Boston, Mass, February 13 There is a regular old-fashioned snowstorm which has been raging throughout New England since early Sunday morning increased in intensity today and by night had developed into a blizzard with the usual accompaniment of stalled railroad trains, paralyzed streetcars and a general blockade. The storm, following the severe cold wave of last week, seems to have been a fitting climax for the severest weather that has been experienced in this region for many years. The main storm began at an early hour this morning and since then it has snowed incessantly, while the northwest gale at times reached a velocity of over 60 miles an hour. The steam railway companies wrestled all day with great drifts but by night the train service was practically suspended throughout New England."

"Though the weatherman had promised warmer temperatures, even Saturday's sunshine failed to prod the mercury up enough to herald the start of the warming trend. It was cold out on the ice of Montreal-area waters, bitterly cold, and when darkness closed in, it grew colder yet. Few anglers ventured out to face a wind-chill capable of freezing skin in just minutes; those who did were able to endure the elements just long enough to set up their rigs, but once the warmth from the exercise had dissipated, the full measure of the cold hit home."

"MO - is JT: &S7 I -s GAZETTE PHOTOS, GORDON BECK Police diver drops through Lake of Two Mountains ice, as search for missing 29-year-old man continues Snowmobile discovered under ice near Oka ALYCIA AMBROZIAK THE GAZETTE Police divers plan to resume their search today for a 29-year-old Oka man believed to have died when his snowmobile fell through the ice into the Lake of Two Mountains. Divers yesterday found a snowmobile they think was driven by Terry Tewisha, who was last seen in Hudson at about 11 p.m. Saturday. A leader of Kanesatake's Mohawk community said the snowmobile accident will hit his community hard, as it comes a week after a resident died when a van plunged through the ice. Police, however, were unable to confirm yesterday that the snowmobile was Tewisha's. Seret du Quebec spokesman Gerard Carrier said visibility under the water ranged from zero to six inches, making it difficult for divers to verify the license-plate number on the sunken snowmobile."
"Seret du Quebec spokesman Gerard Carrier said visibility under the water ranged from zero to six inches, making it difficult for divers to verify the license-plate number on the sunken snowmobile. ""And we can't pull the snowmobile out because the ice is too thin to carry the weight of a tow truck,"" Carrier said. The lake's depth where the divers conducted their search ranged from 15 to 75 feet. The divers suspended the search at about 4:30 p.m. yesterday but Carrier said they planned to resume today. Tewisha's brother, Norman, as well as his cousin, Jean-Claude Angus, the last person to have seen Tewisha alive on Saturday, were among a group of people who withstood sub-zero temperatures yesterday to watch the three police divers plunge into the frigid waters. Hudson police chief Lewis Hayes said he received a telephone call Sunday afternoon from lakeside residents who saw a helmet on the frozen lake. Next to the helmet were snowmobile tracks leading to a patch of unfrozen water. Anguished brother, Norman Tewisha, watched the search. Hayes said Tewisha's relatives said the helmet belonged to the missing man."
"Anguished brother, Norman Tewisha, watched the search. Hayes said Tewisha's relatives said the helmet belonged to the missing man. Angus said he and Tewisha had been ice fishing all day Saturday. ""When we stopped fishing, we had supper at a Hudson restaurant and then went out for a couple of beers,"" Angus said. ""I left on my snowmobile at about 11 p.m. and Terry said he'd be leaving soon. That's the last I saw of him,"" Angus said. Angus then crossed the lake by snowmobile to his Oka home and had no inkling that anything was amiss until the next morning, when Tewisha's mother called looking for her son. Angus said he and his cousin knew there was some danger in riding their snowmobiles over the frozen lake, especially at night. ""You don't see nothing at night,"" he said. ""I don't know if I'll go back out on the ice again."" On Jan. 3, 22-year-old Andrew Simon of Kanesatake died after the van he was riding in plunged through thin ice on the lake between Hudson and Oka."
"On Jan. 3, 22-year-old Andrew Simon of Kanesatake died after the van he was riding in plunged through thin ice on the lake between Hudson and Oka. Three others in the van pulled themselves to safety. Kanesatake Grand Chief Jerry Peltier, who also stood on the lake during the search, said if Tewisha's death is confirmed, it would mark a sad start to the new year. ""If he (Tewisha) died, that makes two tragedies in two weeks for us,"" Peltier said. ""It will be difficult for the community to accept."" Peltier said the band council has issued warnings about the dangers of driving on the ice this year. ""These are the kinds of tragedies that could be avoided had people listened to our warnings as well as the warnings by provincial and local police,"" Peltier said. ""People think that the ice has to be thick because it's January,"" he said. ""But this is an exceptionally mild winter and the ice is not thick."" Police said the ice was only about five inches thick at the spot where police divers conducted their search. ""That's dangerous,"" Peltier said."
"""But this is an exceptionally mild winter and the ice is not thick."" Police said the ice was only about five inches thick at the spot where police divers conducted their search. ""That's dangerous,"" Peltier said. ""For the ice to be safe, it has to be at least 10, if not 12 inches thick."" Peltier said Tewisha was employed by the Mohawk Band Council through the Kanesatake Forestry Corporation, which clears land for Hydro-Quebec lines. ""He was an outdoor-type person, a really good man,"" he said. Tewisha was single and lived with his parents in Oka. JACK TODD Crushed spirit When police broke her arm, woman's life snapped, too."
"Norwegian ship stuck in ice: ST. JOHN'S, Nfld. A Norwegian cargo ship was stuck in thick ice near the coast of western Newfoundland last night but was not in danger of crashing ashore, a search official said. Six people were airlifted by helicopter from the Sea Hawk when the 120-metre ship was trapped near a rocky island in the Bay of Islands area. ""She's got two anchors down in the ice and there's no problem whatsoever,"" said a spokesman from the Search and Rescue Centre in Halifax. Two men, three women and a child, all East Indians, were plucked from the ship by an Armed Forces Labrador helicopter. ""It was snow everywhere,"" said one of the women after she and the others were flown to hospital. ""The island was just a few feet away."""
"STRIKES, ICE STORMS He argued that the overtime strike by blue-collar workers in 1997 slowed snow removal. The blue collars are responsible for half the city's snow-clearing. Then last winter, the big ice storm hit the Montreal region, paralyzing the city for a month. Bourque promised that sidewalks and streets would be cleared quickly this winter. Montreal is more fragile because the elderly population is bigger than in the suburbs. It's important that the sidewalks be cleared as soon as possible, Bourque said he would also focus on improving the service by the traffic department. Stop signs and traffic lights would be put up more quickly in trouble spots under a more decentralized system, he said. Although his administration has been studying whether to charge for services directly, Bourque said it's premature to consider the idea at this stage. Proponents of the pay-as-you-go approach believe that installing water meters, for example, would cut needless consumption. We have to stop wasting city services, he said. Is it by taxing each service? I'm not convinced. The proof must be made. We will be very prudent."

"But by 1958, the order could no longer support itself and sold the property to real-estate developers. Although every effort is made today to retain the beauty and foundations of Stewart Hall, that was not always the case. As developers drew up plans for high-rise apartments through the winter of 1958-59, the unoccupied building suffered extensive damage from wind, ice and snow. Stewarts to the rescue Concerned neighbors, the Stewarts, saved the building from demolition by anonymously purchasing the property and reselling it to the city of Pointe Claire for $1. The only condition was that the section of land between Lakeshore Rd and Lake St. Louis would remain a park. The city has kept its promise; today, approximately 2,000 people a week enjoy Stewart Hall and its surrounding park. The art gallery on the third floor is home to several exhibitions a year and also offers an art rental-and-sales service. Original works by Canadian artists are available for a monthly fee to members of the Pointe Claire public library. All works are framed and ready to hang at home or the office."

Floods force families to flee homes Montreal-area communities spared by cooler weather. BECANCOUR Nearly 150 people fled their homes yesterday when the ice-clogged Becancour River, fed by runoff from an early spring thaw, overflowed its banks. The lower part of the community, halfway between Montreal and Quebec, was inundated when an ice jam formed on Sunday night. Elsewhere in Quebec, an icebreaker was at work yesterday in Riviere des Prairies, near Repentigny, to prevent ice from blocking the river. ""There's always a danger,"" said Lise Theberge of the Environment Department's Montreal office, noting that water levels are high. A return to cool, dry weather had lessened the flood danger around Montreal, she added. ""If the warm weather had continued or there had been more rain, we could have had trouble.""

"Jean-Paul Noel of the Environment Department's Mont茅r茅gie office said yesterday that a few creeks on the South Shore had flooded but no homes or roads were affected. In the village of St. Andre Est, near Lachute, officials called in the Environment Department after the Riviere du Nord was blocked by ice. However, Gilbert Ladouceur, St. Andre's fire chief, said there was no immediate danger. During the weekend, at least 38 families were forced out of their homes in St. Christophe d'Arthabaska, near Victoriaville, and in St. Francois du Lac, east of Sorel. At St. Christophe d'Arthabaska, 78 cows drowned when a barn was flooded. About 200 farm animals were evacuated in the Trois-Rivi猫res region. In the Beauce region south of Quebec City, cooling temperatures kept the Chaudi猫re River from flooding its banks, although sheets of ice, some half a metre thick, lined the shores across the street from Marie-Laure and Antonio Poulin's home in Notre Dame des Pins, near St. Georges."
"After reviewing data provided by the federal Public Works Department, panel chairman David Barnes said yesterday that the proposed bridge would cause ice buildups that could threaten the fishery in the Northumberland Strait. Barnes said the 13-kilometre bridge could delay the springtime departure of ice in the strait by up to two weeks, delaying the lobster season and possibly altering the marine environment due to reduced water temperatures. ""The fishing community stands to bear the greatest risks,"" Barnes said at a news conference. The panel's report also rejected the proposed link based on damage to the marine environment during construction and the possibility of spills of toxic material being carried over the bridge. After reviewing the findings of the six-member environmental assessment panel, which is not binding on government, federal Public Works Minister Elmer MacKay said: ""I am disappointed that the recommendations by the panel do not provide a clearer indication of how the project can be improved to allow it to proceed."" MacKay, whose department ordered the assessment, said he and Environment Minister Robert de Cotret will now consult their staff, the federal Fisheries Department and the governments of all three Maritime provinces."

Freak snow costs plenty Counting the crop damage in Alberta CANADIAN PRESS LETHBRIDGE, Alta. A freak snowstorm that covered much of southern Alberta could cause crop losses as high as 100 per cent in parts of the region. A thick blanket of snow was still covering nearly all the crops in the Pincher Creek area early yesterday. Damage is expected to be extensive, said district agriculturist Bob Lyons. ""It looks like a total disaster here now but maybe after a week of sunshine we'll have a better chance to look at it,"" said Lyons, declining to give a dollar estimate of damage. ""Everything is flat to the ground. Normally, when we get a fall snow during harvest you only get one or two inches and it just sort of tangles everything."
"""Everything is flat to the ground. Normally, when we get a fall snow during harvest you only get one or two inches and it just sort of tangles everything. But the snow will have covered crops for nearly 48 hours before it melts and has likely caused profound damage,"" he said. The storm also caused power outages throughout most of southern Alberta with the thick clumpy snow clinging to lines causing them to droop and snap. Jack MacLean of TransAlta Utilities said crews worked around the clock repairing the damage and had restored power to almost all areas by early yesterday. But there is good news: the weather is expected to improve. Rick Shewchuk of the Lethbridge weather office is forecasting temperatures of 25 degrees C by Wednesday.

Hurricane aims for Florida; 4 die in the Bahamas LARRY R0HTER NEW YORK TIMES MIAMI A ferocious hurricane slammed into the Bahamas yesterday afternoon and swept toward southern Florida, prompting the authorities here to order a million people along the Florida coast to leave their homes in what might be the largest evacuation ever in the United States. Meteorologists said Hurricane Andrew would strike the coast at dawn today with winds of about 240 kilometres an hour. ""This is a killer storm. You need to leave now,"" said Fred Taylor, an emergency worker for Dade County, told people on the coast. Florida Governor Lawton Chiles issued a state of emergency. Yesterday afternoon, Andrew was a Category 4 storm, the same as Hurricane Hugo, with winds of 240 km/h. Forecasters expected it to reach Category 5, the worst, as it crossed the Gulf Stream to Florida. In the Bahamas, Jimmy Curry, director of production for the Bahamas News Bureau, said he had reports of four deaths on either Abaco or Eleuthera."
"In the Bahamas, Jimmy Curry, director of production for the Bahamas News Bureau, said he had reports of four deaths on either Abaco or Eleuthera. The storm apparently spared the Bahamas' most populous section the brunt of its fury, but outer islands might have suffered more damage, according to preliminary reports. The storm passed over Nassau without doing major damage. In Ottawa, the External Affairs Department said there are 312 Canadians registered as residents of the Bahamas but the actual number is probably closer to 500. Not since 1935 has a storm hit Florida with such intensity, and the U.S. National Hurricane Centre in Miami said that the 1935 storm was ""the most intense ever to strike the United States."" The evacuation orders, which began yesterday morning, covered a 400-km coastal belt from Key West to Fort Lauderdale. They extended to low-lying areas and mobile-home communities farther north, and to areas along the southwestern coast as well. It is unclear how many people have actually left their homes. Many are staying, especially those born and raised in Florida. Others have taken to the highways, flown to other cities or moved in with friends or relatives."

Vatican faces strike threat as pope returns REUTER VATICAN CITY Pope John Paul, who underwent surgery more than two months ago, returned to the Vatican yesterday to face a potential revolt over low pay by disgruntled employees of the tiny city-state. During the weekend the board of the Vatican employees' union which represents about half the 2,000 non-clerical workers resigned in protest against what it called intransigence by senior prelates over workers' requests. ""With regret, we have to report the defeat of the path of dialogue and collaboration,"" a union statement said. It was the boldest action ever taken by the Association of Lay Vatican Employees and could lead to the first strike in the history of Vatican City, said church sources. In a toughly worded statement, the nine-member board said Vatican officials have repeatedly delayed action on their requests for raises in salaries and pensions. ""After seven years since the last increase, it is no longer possible to ask us to have patience,"" the statement said."

"Carried out at the 16th-floor offices of Hydro-Quebec's maintenance division, a recent demonstration showed how so far there's been no breakthrough in the war against freezing rain, the public utility prepares to deal with bolts from the blue. As Poupart explained how the software for this lightning-tracking system was developed in Florida and purchased four years ago by Hydro, how the lightning strikes are detected by half a dozen antennae erected across the province that triangulate a lightning strike to within 200 metres of the point of impact, the counter on the screen behind him showed more than 1,000 strokes recorded over a 22-hour period. ""They haven't figured out how to make lightning-proof equipment at Hydro, but newer, sturdier, better insulated equipment has reduced the damage toll. ""We've spent about $138 million on upgrading our equipment and we've gone from having 12,000 transformers blown in 1994 to 450 as of this year,"" said Rejean Levasseur, who runs the utility's maintenance division, noting that Hydro's power distribution network uses more than 500,000 transformers. ""I guess you could say the investment was well spent."""
"""I guess you could say the investment was well spent."" However tough Hydro's power distribution might become, though, fire from heaven still takes its toll: in 1995, lightning strikes accounted for 12,220 power failures in Quebec - about 29 per cent of the provincial total. The numbers changed little last year, with 11,668 blackouts, or 22 per cent of the total. No action soon on English health care CAMPBELL CLARK Gazette Quebec Bureau QUEBEC - The new access plans for English-language health services will not be approved until late August or early September, a spokesman for Health Minister Jean Rochon said yesterday. Rochon made a presentation on the plans to the provincial cabinet last Wednesday, Rochon's spokesman, Martin Caille said. The cabinet made no decision on the plans, and no cabinet meetings are scheduled until August. That marks another in a series of delays in the process of approving the new plans, which outline how healthcare institutions will provide service in English."
"The minister had said a decision on the plans would be made in June, and then said two weeks ago he expected a decision in the next few weeks. David Birnbaum, executive director of Alliance Quebec, said the delay means the English community is left without effective access plans, since the 1989 plans now in effect were drawn up long before the massive changes to Quebec's health-care system. When lightning strikes, they're ready to repair damage total, blamed on thunderstorms. Levasseur said the amount of time it takes for power to be restored to an area depends on the circumstances of the blackout. Levasseur acknowledged that however sophisticated the utility's damage-control policies become for dealing with lightning, so far there's been no breakthrough in the war against freezing rain, which left some North Shore Hydro customers without electricity for days last winter. He said the utility is working on a system that could monitor the weight of freezing rain forming on power lines, but the technology was not yet in use across the power distribution network. Lightning is a source of energy Hydro-Quebec cannot harness, and it is expected once again to blackout homes across the province this summer, as thunderstorms roll across southern Quebec."
"Lightning is a source of energy Hydro-Quebec cannot harness, and it is expected once again to blackout homes across the province this summer, as thunderstorms roll across southern Quebec. The lightning-tracking system might look impressive, but it only allows the utility to make an educated guess about where to deploy its repair crews. And even then, the only way Hydro can know if something as earthbound as windblown branches has knocked out power lines serving only a small percentage of their clientele, is when the affected customer picks up the phone and calls the problem in. In an effort to reduce the time customers spend waiting for repairs to be carried out, Hydro has publicized its 24-hour, toll-free number for reporting power outages - it's (800) 790-2424. It also provided several tips on what to do if your electricity is interrupted. They are: Turn off and unplug appliances, particularly sensitive equipment like computers or microwave ovens. Leave on a couple of lamps and don't touch the fridge or stove. Once power has been restored, restart your appliances one at a time at 30-minute intervals. Avoid using your fridge or freezer unnecessarily."

To rephrase an old golf joke, even God can't hit a 1-iron, but lightning can. Actually, lightning can hit just about anything on a golf course even you, and that's no joke. Lightning kills more people every year in North America than tornadoes, hurricanes and floods. The June issue of Golf Digest reports that more than 200 Americans are killed by lightning every year and it's estimated that five times that many people are struck."
"Plates regularly shift along fault line; tension and slipping cause quakes. TEHRAN The toll in the earthquake that jolted northern Iran early yesterday rose to at least 25,000 dead, with tens of thousands reported injured, and it could go much higher when rescuers reach remote areas. The Iranian ambassador to the United Nations, Kamal Kharrazi, said yesterday afternoon on Cable News Network that the latest word he has received from the Foreign Ministry in Tehran was that an earlier estimate of at least 10,000 dead was far too conservative. And he said that even the latest figures are likely to increase as rescuers reach remote areas. Iran needs medical equipment, blood, blankets and medicine, he said. ""I understand that international organizations are trying their best to bring some of this equipment and medicine."" The earlier estimate was contained in a statement by the Iranian cabinet, made public after an emergency evening session. The announcement carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency placed all government organizations on full alert, and ordered an air bridge set up between Tehran and the stricken areas to evacuate survivors."
"The announcement carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency placed all government organizations on full alert, and ordered an air bridge set up between Tehran and the stricken areas to evacuate survivors. Landslides blocked rescuers on the ground, and bad weather hindered helicopters trying to fly in supplies and take out victims, the news agency reported. Many people remained buried in the debris, the report said, and several hundred Revolutionary Guards were flown from Tehran to bolster rescue teams.
