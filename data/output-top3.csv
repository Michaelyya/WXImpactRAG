The rains have caused a rise of nearly two feet in the Chippewa and Eau, which is perceptible at this point, and there is a prospect of the ice moving out of the Dells reservoir and other dams above before the close of the week, leaving the river free for a resumption of raft and boat navigation. The improvement at the mills are about completed, and there is a possibility that several of the establishments having a surplus of logs from last season will commence operations this week. A large number of men were sent up both rivers this morning, so as to be in readiness for the drive, which is anticipated to take place earlier than usual. ON THE WOLF AND WAUPACA RIVERS, Waupaca, Wisconsin, March 30 The lumbermen, with their teams, are rushing out of the woods and spending a few days in the cities preparatory to going on to the river. The rivers are all open now, but the dams are frozen to such an extent that logs cannot be run through. On the Wolf, Little Wolf and Waupaca rivers are large crops of logs, and the present season will be a good one for rivermen. The Wisconsin Central Railway is running extra log trains daily, and there is said to be logs enough on their line north of Stevens Point to furnish business for the road all summer. The Weed & Gumaer Manufacturing Company of Weyauwega buys logs from one hundred miles north, saws them at their mills at that place, and re-ships the dressed lumber back to Stevens Point, forty miles north of Weyauwega. There are several new sawmills being erected at the small towns on the railroad, and a lively business will be carried on this summer.","It is, however, only by the application of a comprehensive simultaneous system that the full significance of such phenomena can be ascertained.

Maximum body counts? Just a little blood and gore? Only some weapons and bombs? What about battle scenes in historical films? What about implied violence? Psychological violence? What about murders in films based on actual events? What about natural violence: earthquakes and fires with their hundreds of dead? Is violence only acceptable when it is real? Can violence be good or bad, necessary or gratuitous, didactic or harmful?","DENVER - Coors Field served up a long, frosty one on opening day.

It is now conceded that the majority of our prevailing diseases, including consumption (that spectre of every northern fireside) are more or less closely associated with failure of the digestive process otherwise what we familiarly call indigestion or dyspepsia. Now, as the digestion of food is, beyond question, the superlative function performed within the human body, illness in various forms must result from any imperfection in it, as death rapidly follows upon its complete arrest. It would seem a rational conclusion that any hope of finding a preventive of disease must be founded upon our knowledge of how to control the digestion and maintain it in normal health and vigor indefinitely. On no other theory can we expect to see men die of old age only."

"What is the amount owed by the Street Railway company to the city for snow removal from the tracks last winter, and how might this impact the city's financial situation?","Ouimet inquired whether there was any way by which they could vary some appropriation so as to apply it for repairing sidewalks, notwithstanding the 15th section of the new charter, which enacts that no amount appropriated can be varied or applied to any other purpose, except such change in the appropriation in question is approved by a vote of the whole council. The City Surveyor said he could not see how he could vary any of the Road Committee appropriations for the purpose of cleaning the streets. The chairman considered the Finance Committee ought to give some money to the Road Committee for the purpose of repairing the sidewalks, which were in a very bad condition, indeed; and it was resolved to petition the Finance Committee accordingly, asking for an appropriation of $15,000 for the repair of sidewalks and the like.

This is why Mr. Chapleau cannot attend the Monument National demonstration in Montreal tomorrow night. Dr. Grondin says that while the Governor is not at present dangerously ill, he might become so unless he takes several weeks' rest, and tonight a bulletin was issued to this effect.

What specific impacts did the storm have on infrastructure in the principal street and how did these impacts potentially affect human health in the area?,"While climate plays a major role in shaping ecosystems, Denevan and others argue that the pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America, for example, were more open and park-like as a result of burning than they were in 1750, after the Indian population of the western hemisphere had been decimated by diseases imported from Europe. The thick primeval forests of colonial times, Denevan argues, represent a recovery from the impact of the Indians at their zenith. In attacking what he calls ""the pristine myth,"" Denevan's September 1992 review, published in the Annals of the American Association of Geographers, offers this summary: ""By 1492 Indian activity throughout the Americas had modified forest extent and composition, created and expanded grasslands and rearranged topography through countless artificial earthworks. Agricultural fields were common, as were houses and towns and roads and trails. All of these had local impacts on soil, microclimate, hydrology and wildlife. Even mild impacts and slow changes, Denevan wrote, add up to dramatic long-term effects. While the impact was not as extensive as that of modern people, he wrote, the paradise that Columbus thought he had found was clearly a humanized paradise.""","to attend the three-day conference that wrapped up yesterday at the Sheraton Centre Each participant represented a country or non-governmental organization with the goal of reaching a consensus on how ethically to fill shortages in the medical field without poaching doctors from developing countries Participants said Quebec has to do a better job of retaining the BUYING Meet Jamie Wolfe, the 25-year-old buyer for Boutique ArneUe She was one of dozens, maybe hundreds, of Montrealers working New York's Coterie trade show last week in the hunt for the hot fall trends TOMORROW IN ARTS & LIFE A former head of the Montreal Board of Trade, he was elected borough mayor of Ville Marie, a high maintenance district that includes downtown He is media-friendly, expresses himself well in both official languages and has enough connections in Montreal's business community to give Tremblay a run for his money Problem is, until last autumn, Labonte was a Vision Montreal enemy He ran alongside Tremblay as a star candidate in 2005 and was on the city's executive committee He broke ranks last September, sitting as an independent Finally, in November, he joined Vision Montreal and since then has been making noises about probably running for mayor next year Yesterday, Labonte made an appearance at the party gathering"," regular stuff, but less of it, enjoying it proportionately more, Lingering, inhaling, savoring slowly, I am not confined to carrot sticks, I should tell you, A single bite of an outrageously delicious dessert can give more pure pleasure than two pieces once did, I am taking it very slowly, eating just a little less, exercising just a little more, enjoying the process, the re-emergence of my old, funny, nobby hipbones, What's more, I am discovering a new range of gourmandises, Bath mousse eloquently scented with passion fruit - a pleasure which has no side-effects, Blackberry soap, which stinks up the bathroom delightfully, Natural peach essence behind my ears, or natural strawberry essence, adored by my two little boys, The other night we sat in Nicholas's lower bunk bed and inhaled a whole strawberry field, In sum, I have discovered a garden of earthly delights, Small is not only beautiful, but delicious, B Bee Mac Guire writes about Montreal life every week in The Sunday Gazette, CHOICE CATCH Lobsters are arriving in town from Îles de la Madeleine, the source of 90 per cent of Quebec's catch, Johanna Burkhard"

Nolan had to demand to be on the committee. Aid. Nolan replied somewhat warmly to the effect that St. Ann's ward had suffered most from floods, it was most interested in flood prevention, and should not be ignored. Aid.

There was the customary squabble over the appointment of the Inundation committee, or the Harbor Improvement and Flood Prevention committee as Aid Wilson wished to call it. Aid Wilson moved that it be comprised of Aid Wilson, Prefontaine, Cresso, Clendinning, A Dubuc, Beausoleil and Tansey. Aid Stevenson objected that this was substantially the Road committee and said that the two should be joined. It employed an engineer who only worked six weeks in the year. There was a great deal in the point just raised by Aid McBride that St Ann's and the West ward, the two most interested, should be given representation on the board. Aid Stearns agreed with this view and moved in amendment that the names of Aid Stevenson and Kennedy be added to the committee. This raised the question as to whether the committee should be increased in numbers or not, for the council has a dread of large committees and Aid Prefontaine objected on this ground."

Wilson said he did not object to the gentlemen suggested, but he did to cumbersome committee. Aid. Stevenson said if anyone had a right to complain it was himself. He had been systematically ignored in connection with it. He recapitulated the work he had done in preventing floods and continued that as soon as the work was completed, he would be relieved. They had done his working on his ideas. The question then dropped, Aid. Nolan giving notice of motion to have the formation of the committee reconsidered. The Board of Health for the city was appointed, and the assessment roll for grand and petit jurors was approved of.

He said Ottawa has a responsibility to enforce national health-care standards. I think that we're seeing pressure at the level of some provinces to challenge the basic assumptions of medicare and that's a real concern, he said. Under the Canada Health Act, Ottawa can withhold health-care money if provinces allow extra billing by doctors or user fees for medical services. But under federal restraint measures, cash payments to provinces for medicare and post-secondary education will be gone in Quebec by 1996, in Ontario by 2002 and in most other provinces and territories by 2007, according to the National Council of Welfare. In the budget brought down Tuesday, Finance Minister Michael Wilson promised legislation to give the federal government power to withhold other money if provinces don't meet the medicare standards of the health act. Ottawa will transfer an estimated $24 billion in cash to provinces this year, about a quarter of it specifically for health care and $12.4 billion in taxing powers.","The inept intruder broke into the garage of an apartment building on Snowdon St last Thursday around 4 a.m. Constable Elizabeth Kraska of Montreal Urban Community Police Station 25 said the thief caused more than $6,000 damage when he pulled out the door locks and broke open the ignitions on six vehicles before breaking into a car he succeeded in starting. The son of the building's janitor may have thought he was in a bad dream when he was wakened several times by car alarms that were triggered during the attempted thefts. Still, he only got out of bed and called police after he heard the garage door open, Kraska said. ""He didn't think anything important was going on,"" Kraska said.

What specific impacts did the storms have on transportation infrastructure in the region as described in the passage?,"The road which winds through the hilly Laurentian park is heavily traveled by trucks and swept by wild weather. Blowing snow and icy pavement make it particularly scary in winter. Between 1994 and 2001 there were more than 2,000 accidents on the highway causing 43 deaths and 100 serious injuries. Local leaders say the difficult conditions on the road have also put a brake on the region's economy which suffers from one of the worst unemployment problems in the country. Last month the jobless rate in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region stood at 12.2 per cent compared with 8.7 per cent for Quebec as a whole.

First-generation Indo-Canadian immigrants still have close family ties in India and often like to sponsor close family members for a visit to Canada. Instead of denying them a visitor's visa on the rather humiliating grounds that they might not go back to their country of origin, would it not be better to ask the sponsoring relative in Canada to post a bond or furnish a binding legal guarantee for their return? At home, our government can apply stricter controls on the issuing of social insurance numbers and medicare cards to deter illegitimate visitors.

The rain, which set in at 6 o'clock on Monday evening, continued without intermission until after 9 o'clock last night, and by that time an extraordinary amount of inches had fallen. The rain fell steadily all day and made outdoor life more than unpleasant. Consequently, nobody stirred out unless it was absolutely necessary. All outdoor labor was stopped, and it will take the shipping interests and the road contractors considerable time to recover from the damage done. One feature of the heavy rainfall was that it gave the Road Department considerable trouble. Mr. St. George said yesterday that the department had never had a worse experience in getting the water away through the sewers than during that rainfall. The William Street sewer, with which there had been no trouble previously, could scarcely carry off the flow. Some of the other sewers were also choked up."," his deafness had become intolerable, Toward the end, he developed dropsy - an illness that caused his body to retain water and swell, The painful disease took four months to run its course, Beethoven slipped into a coma, Compose your thoughts As you read the articles on this page, look for the answers to the following questions, 1 What was the name of the era in which Beethoven lived?"," his deafness put him out of touch with people, Beethoven grew bitter toward the Viennese, even though most of them had always been supportive of him Beethoven died a shabby and unhappy man at 57 He had been sick during most of the previous decade with various illnesses, and his deafness had become intolerable Toward the end, he developed dropsy - an illness that caused his body to retain water and swell The painful disease took four months to run its course Beethoven slipped into a coma Compose your thoughts As you read the articles on this page, look for the answers to the following questions 1 What was the name of the era in which Beethoven lived?"

Twenty patients in the emergency room at Maisonneuve-Rosemont had been there for more than 48 hours.

""There are different reasons, and a lack of resources is one of them.

It opposes its swiftness to the speed of the trains, its cold to the heat of locomotive furnaces, its wide sweep to the narrowness of the track. The cost of fighting one of these blizzards is enormous. Every cut on the line is filled to the brim with snow that is often packed like sand. But it does not require a deep cut to enable the blizzard to stop trains. A foot, even six inches, of the packed drift will bring them to a standstill. The snowplow may be forced through by a long line of pulling locomotives, but before the train that follows can get well under way the snow has sifted in again and progress is impossible. And the blizzard brings accidents and wrecks in great numbers. The flying snow and the clouds of steam make it almost impossible for the engineer to see signals. On each division, a snowplow must be kept at work, and from four to eight locomotives are required to push it. A few days ago it required fourteen engines to get a short train of five cars to the yards in Chicago."

Finally, around 2002, it occurred to me that she was right: they were too sketchy for non-fiction but they might provide the basis for a novel. It took six years of labor and countless rewrites and it would horrify her self-effacing soul to see herself depicted in fiction but here it is, Sun Going Down, a novel. A Mother's Day present, two decades too late. If I could, I'd mail it to her with a picture of 2-year-old Theo, a sunny boy with dimples deep as the furrows in a Nebraska field, born in a different country and a different century but still Maxine's grandson.","THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, MONDAY, OCTOBER 27, 1997 WORLD Western states dig out B8 Associated Press DENVER - Rescuers used helicopters, snowmobiles and military vehicles yesterday to pick up snowbound travellers and residents left without heat by a record blizzard in the western United States that piled snowdrifts up to 4.5 metres high.

Nearly every underground trolley line in the city was inoperative all day, owing to the filling up of the slot by freezing sleet, and then filling the conduit with snow and sleet, thus making the trolley wires unavailable. Hundreds of men were employed by the trolley companies to put them in condition, but their efforts were futile.","A6 THE GAZETTE, MONTREAL, FRIDAY, MARCH 14, 2008 City editor: Ross Teague 514-987-2462 rteaguethegazette.canwest.com Assignment editor: 514-987-2617 citynewsthegazette.canwest.com Snow-clogged sidewalks halt mail delivery Missing limo drives TOO DANGEROUS!

"What measures did the police implement in response to the snowstorm, and what were the consequences of these measures on the individuals brought to the police courts?","Pierre Bourque TeamBourque Vision Montreal Emergency services The Montreal transition committee is proposing the elimination of 78 firefighting jobs and the closing of some fire stations once the new city is created. Do you support these measures, and why or why not? Bourque The transition committee's proposal is the result of serious analysis and studies done by experts and the directors of the island's different firefighting services. If, after reviewing the report, the security of citizens is not fully guaranteed, we will make the necessary modifications. The new city will have the necessary flexibility to freely redeploy staff and equipment on the island since the city of Montreal's minimum employment level will be abolished in January. Do you think that Montreal is at risk for a terrorist attack of some kind? If so, what readiness measures will you take? Bourque The chances Montreal will be a target are remote. Still, as mayor, I have to be ready to respond. In any crisis situation, like the one I experienced during the ice storm, I would work closely with our Emergency Preparedness Centre and with our governments and agencies in dealing with the emergency. What is your plan for creating an island-wide emergency medical response service, and what is the timeline?","All the while, Drapeau, who acted as if he were project-construction manager, denounced everybody - except Taillibert - as pessimists because ""there were no problems, only solutions."" Meanwhile, the 1,000 or so big and small contracts were all executed on a cost-plus basis, so there was no incentive to control costs. On the contrary, the stadium design was of almost impossible complexity, with the geometry and engineering baffling even the most adept experts. There were 34 overhanging ribs, stretching 40 metres above the stadium field, all delicately balanced and cantilevered to support enormous weights. No two sections were alike. Each of the 2,000 pre-stressed concrete components of the ribs, built at a factory in Saint-Eustache, had to be individually engineered and poured in individual forms. When engineers suggested the design be made more uniform and symmetrical, saving perhaps $50 million, the mayor and Taillibert blew their tops. Taillibert's previous major work, the Parc des Princes stadium in Paris, was erected with one 150-tonne crane. That's because it was built on a sane timetable, so equipment could be moved around as it was needed.","""Putting up iron shutters would make our city look like Los Angeles,"" said Mark Bayley, assistant manager of the Roots clothing boutique near McGill College Ave. ""Why should we stoop so low because the police didn't do their jobs?"" Falah Alqassab, who owns the Cite Mag souvenir shop near Bleury St., said iron shutters aren't a foolproof way of preventing break-ins.

No accidents have been reported and although the storm has raged with great severity along the coast no marine disasters have been announced. The storm was general throughout New England and reports come from various points of drifted roads and delayed trains. Several trains are reported stalled on the Boston and Maine Railway in Maine and a train is stalled at Stratham, N.H. December 26.

The heaviest part of the storm was in the southwestern part of New England, that section experiencing a snowfall of from 18 to 24 inches. Fortunately the storm was heralded sufficiently in advance by the Weather Bureau to detain most of the coastwise shipping in safe harbors, but the warning was entirely ignored by those on shore, with the result that nearly everyone, especially the railroads and electric companies, were caught napping and suffered accordingly.","Notwithstanding this precaution on the part of the police, there were a number of casualties, including several deaths from exposure.

"What specific impacts did the snowstorm have on transportation and human safety in Hartford, Connecticut, as described in the passage?","The building, which was a tin-sheeted structure, was destroyed, and the valuable plant which it contained is a total loss. The escape of the Western Station, which was erected in 1892, was a marvel, as the distance between the two buildings is only about twenty feet. The fire was first discovered at 4:30 a.m. under the western dynamo. The employees extinguished the blaze, as they thought, but the fire broke out again some minutes later, and was soon beyond the reach of the men. Trains, both east and west, have been delayed greatly by the fire. The greater part of the street lighting of the city will be crippled until such time as new dynamos can be put in place. The entire east end of the city will be in darkness.

In Spain rain has fallen pretty generally, thus preventing what might have been a serious disaster to the crops. The wheat crop is now regarded as likely to prove a short one, but much better than was expected a fortnight ago. The latest report of the French Agricultural Society says that the wheat crop has in general a fine appearance and is growing well with the recent mild weather. Spring sowings were effected in good condition, but they badly want rain. The Agricultural Journal expresses the opinion that the present drought in England is very serious, and spring corn is suffering severely. Wheat is falling color, but is still very healthy. The River Plate News of April 25th says the exports of wheat for the current year will pass 600,000 tons, and it is foolish in the extreme to state that exports will not exceed 400,000 tons. When we look at what has already gone forward, and at the visible supplies held in the principal ports, it is easy to see that this latter figure will be exceeded."

She has written frequently to the latter, enquiring very compassionately regarding her health, and expressing the hope that her bereavement has now lost its keenness. Mrs. Gladstone has been greatly touched by the tenderness and sympathy which marked these epistles. Her health has improved during the last few weeks. There is some discussion this week as to whether the Queen will again go to the south of France next spring, in view of the Anglophobe feeling excited by the Fashoda dispute.","These outbursts on the part of the French newspapers are having a certain effect, and letters are appearing in the English newspapers urging that pressure be exercised in the proper quarters to induce the Queen not to go to the French Riviera, but to go to Florence instead.

Now, the Kirschvinks and their associates are trying to determine whether honeybees actually use their magnetite as an internal compass. Scientists wonder whether people also have a navigational sense that helped the Polynesians, Australian Aborigines and American Indians, for example, to pioneer new routes. Evidence that some animals sense direction by orienting themselves in Earth's magnetic field has been accumulating for decades. Northbound bacteria In 1975, a scientist discovered a group of bacteria that orient themselves in the Earth's magnetic field and always seem to swim north. Researchers found that the bacteria sensed direction by producing their own internal compasses, crystals of magnetite. Scientists soon discovered similar magnetite crystals in the heads of honeybees, abdomens of pigeons and bodies of other animals. Extremely tiny quantities of magnetite are detectable in all parts of the human brain, according to Kirschvink. But the meninges - thin membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord - contain about 20 times the average. Although the amounts of magnetite found in the human brain are small, they could be sufficient to produce an effect when the brain is exposed to strong electromagnetic fields."

The early arrival of northern birds, such as shore larks, Lapland longspurs and pine-grosbeaks, was this fall followed almost immediately by a frosty wave during the first week of October; but this was of but brief duration, and had the birds known more, they need not have fled with such precipitancy from their northern haunts. In my own experience I have never yet found the movements of birds worthy of consideration in a weather point of view, except, indeed, as foretelling the approach of such a temporary ""cold snap"" as that we have recently experienced, and which of itself indicates the very reverse of an early and severe setting in of winter; for early cold and bluster, in general, is not lasting, and is almost invariably followed by an open term.","On the other hand, and jumping skyward, if we are to believe what English and American scientists tell us about the activity on the sun's surface and the number and magnitude of sun spots, we feel disposed to announce the probability of a continuance of heat or warmth and periods of considerable disturbances for the winter of 1882.

Every day the Winnipeg papers chronicle the arrival of one or more trains filled with these people. Besides this, there is already at hand the vanguard of what promises to be a large European immigration, the result of work done during the winter and former years.

The course made was a little more northerly than was thought safe, but fortunately no icebergs or field ice were observed.

The course of politics did not run smooth. Montreal was the seat of government, the Legislature assembling in the building erected for St. Ann's market. The speaker of the Assembly did not understand the French language, and when Mr. ex-attorney-general Aylwin wished to flag the vegetable Mr. Viger to an extent which the rules of the House would hardly permit, he used that language knowing that the chair at least could not call him to order. At length, in 1849, Lord Elgin, who gave the royal assent to the Rebellion Losses Bill, was mobbed and the Parliament Buildings burned down, and the result was that Montreal lost the seat of government. Lord Elgin, he said, was a popular Governor on the whole, and took a deep interest in our institutions. In 1852 the amended charter of McGill College was obtained and the institution placed on truly broad and catholic foundation, religious but non-denominational.","The borough's new truck can salt much more roadway than an older salt truck before it has to return to the garage for refilling, he said. In fact, Montreal tested pre-wetting salt between 1992 and 1994 and saw positive results, Girard revealed. The result was more or less conclusive, he said. But the city balked at the amount of training that would have been required for all of its blue-collar workers, Girard said. Meanwhile, preventive liquid icing or anti-icing is non-existent in Montreal, even though it's done in Europe and increasingly in North America.

In fact, Montreal tested pre-wetting salt between 1992 and 1994 and saw positive results, Girard revealed. The result was more or less conclusive, he said. But the city balked at the amount of training that would have been required for all of its blue-collar workers, Girard said. Meanwhile, preventive liquid icing or anti-icing is non-existent in Montreal, even though it's done in Europe and increasingly in North America. Clearing a winter storm Some new salting methods used by other cities can improve safety and efficiency. The methods can also cut the amount of salt used by an estimated 20%.

How did the flooding impact the operations and infrastructure of the police and fire stations in the affected area?,"PAGE B3 The Macphenon III: Part of the first phase of the massive Hydro-Quebec project, the LG2 spillway is carved into the rock beside the dam. Picture a spring day next year in northern Quebec. Spruce trees crash before bulldozers as workers blaze a trail for the road to Hydro-Quebec's James Bay project, the beginning of James Bay. Suddenly, work stops. Blocking the way is a cluster of tents, and in the center stands a 71-year-old Inuk woman, Mina Weetaltuk, waving a stick at the advancing work crew. After last summer's Oka crisis, this vision is enough to make politicians shudder. But as Hydro pushes ahead determined to meet its 1998 deadline for completing the power project and enjoying the Quebec government's blessing, natives in Great Whale, the community most affected by the project, are starting to talk about a showdown. ""Oh yes, we'll be right in the middle,"" Weetaltuk said this week when asked if she would take part in a blockade natives are considering. James Masty checks a marten trap near Great Whale.","But like Masty and Petagumskum, most people retain a strong link with the land and waters that surround them. Thirty Cree families about one-fifth of the Cree population spend months in the bush every fall and winter, trapping, hunting and fishing. Others who have jobs in town take advantage of the weekends to stock their freezers with caribou, fish, geese, and other game. The situation is similar for the Inuit, although their activities are concentrated along the coast of Hudson Bay where they fish and hunt seals, beluga whales, caribou and fowl. Robert Brunette, vice-president of Amerindian and Inuit affairs for Hydro, says the road to Great Whale will have a greater impact on the natives than the dams. ""The Cree and Inuit are worried that if roads are open to the general public, people will go hunting and fishing without any control,"" he said in an interview. One possibility would be to re-evaluate the impact of the road on the native community.","The incident occurred between midnight and 7 a.m. OUR FAMOUS LASAGNA TURKEY BREAST REGULAR $12. CLOSING (RESTAURANT ONLY)! Police left me on street, mugging victim complains. CHARLIE FIDELMAN THE GAZETTE COTE DES NEIGES A Cote des Neiges woman complained this week that police officers treated her insensitively when she reported a brutal purse-snatching incident Monday. Waitress Roberta Gougeon, 45, was walking on Decelles Ave at 4:45 a.m. to catch a bus to work when she was jumped by two men. The assailants shoved her to the pavement, kicked her in the ribs and smashed her head on the sidewalk before running off with her purse. Bruised and traumatized, Gougeon returned home and called 911. Gougeon said two Montreal Urban Community police officers from Station 31 drove her to the scene of the crime at Linton Ave and Decelles. ""I showed them where it happened. They took a report,"" Gougeon recalled. She sat in the back of the police car as they did the paperwork, she said."
"How did the flood, caused by the breaking-up of ice above the Lachine Rapids, specifically impact the infrastructure and human activities at the Point police station and the fire station on Centre Street?","The Allan steamship office and the Harbor Commissioners' building were in the same fix. About 2 o'clock or a little later a slight fall took place and the water retired somewhat, but it was for a short time only. By 3 o'clock it was higher in the streets than ever. McGill was covered as far as the Albion hotel, and the water had risen and covered the sections of Wellington, William and intersecting streets. At 10 o'clock the state of things was worse at night than on the city side of the canal. In Congregation, Wellington, Hacdalen, Consol, Forfar, Grand Trunk, Richardson, Patrick and other streets the water rose to a height of two or three feet, according to the level. The sidewalks floated round and were used by the inhabitants as rafts to keep up communication with each other. At the Point police station there was five feet of water in the cellar, and the policemen had removed their coal to one of the cells for safe keeping. The fire station on Centre Street was cut off by several feet of water.","The strength of the ice below determines the character of the flood caused by ice from the lakes above coming down to the channel, if the ice is strong below, or to force the whole away if the ice below is weak. The places where ice grounds and closes the waterway are easily seen, because of the high mounds of ice raised by the shore; at these places, I can remember one year the shove extended to shore, and did much injury to vessels, docks, etc. Another year the ice shoved from the south to the north side of the river, piling mountains high in front of the city and up on the street, damaging buildings, while the flood took the south side to St. Lambert and Longueuil till the height and force of the water opened the channel. Another year the ice shoved to the south, from the Lachine Rapids to the shoals above the Victoria Bridge, attending to the south embankment, and piled upon it about sixteen feet above the track and blocked the traffic, and caused a flood at Laprairie and Lower Lachine.","The strength of the ice below determines the character of the flood caused by ice from the lakes above coming down to the channel, if the ice is strong below, or to force the whole away if the ice below is weak.

"What specific infrastructural damage was caused by the moving ice and accompanying flood in the area between Vaudreuil and St. Johns, and how does this compare to the flood of 1861 in terms of economic and ecological impact according to the passage?","In the winter of 1809-10, the water rose high enough to float timber over Grey Nun street. In later years the greatest rise was that of 1837-38, when the water rose about one foot higher than in the present year. That in 1839-40, although higher than usual, was three feet lower than that of this year. The duration of the highest winter flood varies. It generally does not exceed two days, as was the case this year and the preceding, but in 1837-38, which was a very mild winter, the flood was very high, though perhaps not at its highest, during fourteen days. Some relief may, however, be expected in less than twenty-four hours. The city is always more or less affected by it in the cellars for several weeks. The greatest flood is about 20 feet above summer level in the harbour and about 12 feet difference at St. Mary's Rapid, between the two periods, at that place.","In the winter of 1809-10, the water rose high enough to float timber over Grey Nun street.

"What specific areas in the city have been newly affected by the floodwaters, and how has this impacted the infrastructure such as streets and cellars?","Finance Minister Paul Martin announced yesterday that Ottawa will hand out $2.65 billion over the next six years to improve the country's local infrastructure, such as roads, social housing and parks. The federal government promised $100 million in the next fiscal year, $350 million in 2001-2002 and $550 million in each of the following four years. ""The capacity to move people and goods safely and efficiently is key to an innovative and productive economy,"" Martin said yesterday in his budget address. ""We will work with other orders of government and, where applicable, the private sector to reach agreement on a plan,"" Montreal Mayor Pierre Bourque said yesterday the city expects to receive about $150 million from the program over the next six years and that the water-distribution system, which serves 16 island municipalities and is more than half a century old in some areas, will be the main beneficiary of the new spending. ""Montreal has a very old network of aqueducts and it is in dire need of repair,"" Bourque said. ""The network loses about 30 to 40 per cent of its water,"" Bourque said, and is prone to repeated contaminations.","Weekends, too? Oh, yes, she said That leaves the wider, deeper issue of why Montreal has so many potholes every single winter Money?","""When it snows, we're the transport mode that is affected the least,"" said Benoit Simoneau, a Via official in Montreal. ""When the roads and airports are closed, we're still open."" The second storm in three days has made snow clearing ""very difficult"" for the city of Montreal, according to Katerine Auclair, an official with the city's public-works department. About 1.2 million cubic metres of snow fell on city territory Tuesday, she said, and city snow-blowers and dump trucks had removed 500,000 cubic metres before yesterday's storm forced work crews to revert to snowplowing. ""Everything is going according to plan,"" Auclair said. In the suburbs, snowplowing was similarly a priority. By noon yesterday, all Beaconsfield streets had been plowed, said Patrice Boileau, that city's director of public works. ""By that point, 15 per cent of the streets were clear"" as a result of snow-blowing operations, he said. Residential suburban neighbourhoods with driveways and no sidewalks are easier to plow than inner-city areas."
"What specific challenges did the Central fire station on Craig Street face during the flooding, and how did the firemen adapt to these conditions according to the passage?","Mr. Maruchal, administrator of the diocese, who said Mass and delivered an interesting sermon. The questions put to the novices at the time of their profession were interpreted to them by signs, by Rev. Abba Trspanior, the chaplain of the Institution. Those deaf and dumb novices will be under the same rules as those in the Providence convent, but they will form a special class under the care of the Little Sisters of Our Lady of the Seven Sorrows. The superior-general of the Sisters of Providence will be their superior. The names of the novices were: Aline Létourneau, Rosalie Geoffroy, Alexine Bolvin, Emilio Montpelier, and Marie Eugenie Lamy.

A fireman had died in the discharge of his duty. About 8 o'clock on Saturday evening an alarm of fire was given from box 64, for a small fire in a hayloft at 309 Craig Street.","In the city itself the water extends to districts never before affected. Craig Street and St. Antoine Street from St. Henri Street to St. Urbain Street is covered. Victoria Square is a lake. The low part of Vitre Street in rear of the drill shed is flooded, and the cellars of the houses in the neighborhood filled. Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street. It is impossible at the present time to form any estimate of the damage that has been done on the flooded streets. It would be easier to say who had not than who had suffered. Coming higher than was anticipated, higher than was ever before known, the water reached many houses and business places that made no preparation for such an event, and it was in these that the greatest damage occurred. THE SCENES ON SUNDAY. About 1 o'clock on Sunday morning a sudden rise took place, filling many cellars that had hitherto escaped, as far from the river Craig Street, among these those of the Gazette and St. Lawrence Hall. At 11 o'clock another rise took place, and by 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon had flooded the low-lying parts of the central district of the city.","Chenneville and St. George Streets are in the same position where they run into Craig Street.

"What specific challenges did the flooding present to the Central fire station and its personnel, and how did these challenges impact the firemen’s ability to respond effectively?","Using blunt language uncharacteristic of his predecessors, Fraser not only took issue with Curzi, but warned that if politicians continue to ratchet up their nationalist rhetoric, Quebec anglophones could get caught in the crossfire. ""Pierre Curzi suggested very clearly on the radio that people living in the West Island of Quebec weren't really Quebecers,"" Fraser said. ""I'm sorry. The English minority in Quebec has made extraordinary progress over the last 30 years. It is significantly more bilingual than the French-speaking majority. Eighty per cent of young, English-speaking Quebecers are bilingual. This is a dramatic sign of adaptation to the new realities of Quebec. I think it is unfortunate that these extraordinary measures that have been taken by the English community to respond to the challenges of the changing Quebec are being greeted in a mean-spirited way."" Fraser also mused about taking the federal government to court over its cancellation of the court challenges program that helped linguistic minorities take Charter of Rights cases to court.","S Congress and woeful in their management of last year's meeting of the World Trade Organization, which became guerrilla theatre in the streets of Seattle, George W. Bush, like his father before him, is an unencumbered free trader. Without the presence of peacekeepers, including Canadians, the entire area would erupt all over again into warring fragments. Montenegro and Macedonia also are fragile nations whose citizens have divided loyalties. Although the current government in tiny Montenegro with a population of 600,000 is pro-Western, many Montenegrins are pro-Serb. Macedonia, with approximately one quarter of its 2 million population Albanian and 30 per cent Serb, is a tinderbox just waiting for extremists to set it afire. Albania, with a small Greek minority in its southern region, has its own unique divisions between the north, mainly Catholics, and those in the centre and south, predominantly Muslim. Although all profess to be Albanians, this did not stop them from plunging Albania into civil war in 1997 which required Greek and Italian troops to restore order. The Kosovar Albanians themselves have mental illnesses.","- and the Flyers had put four past him by the time Campbell mercifully gave him the hook. ""When everyone on your team including your goaltender is making mistakes, that's pretty hard to recover from,"" said Campbell, who's been coaching from the edge of a cliff all season and may topple over shortly. ""But the Rangers aren't exactly helping him out. Perhaps they can't."" If the overtime games in Philadelphia foreshadowed a changing of the guard in the East, the 5-2 mismatch at the Garden confirmed it. New Yorkers should recognize the symptoms. ""In 1983, experience and grit and the remains of some surpassing talents - Bossy, Trottier, Polvin, Smith - was enough for the aging New York Islanders to postpone the inevitability of the Edmonton Oilers. But one more year was all it took for the hill to get too steep to climb."" New challenges ""I think every year brings new challenges and scenarios, and as athletes, we're here to respond to them as they come,"" said Glenn Healy, who came on in relief of Richter and was one of very few Rangers to come out to face the music later. ""Certainly a year makes a difference."
"How did the flooding impact transportation and commerce between Wellington and St. Peter Streets, and what unique business practices emerged as a result?","On Honavenltir Street, a little west of Victoria Square, the water suddenly made its appearance and spread along as far as the eye could reach. The street was also submerged from HUGH beyond the American building to some distance past Craig Street.

There were three feet of water on the ground floor of the main building. The water was literally covered with rafts, boats and debris of all descriptions, and the streets were in constant communication with the main roads and accidents were numerous. One man, having broken up a raft and cast its remnants into the water, was laughing at the predicament he found himself in when he drove into the water, giving a sudden lurch that sent him into the water too.

How has the flooding affected the infrastructure on Commissioners Street and what potential risks do the stevedores' offices face according to the passage?,"Do you not think it advisable on this point to grant the interested parties time to find out the nature and extent of the powers given to the municipality by the new charter before asking them to impose on their properties a loan of a million? The last part of the by-law says that the million will be applied to prevent flooding and improve the city. The second part says: ""The product of said loan will be applied exclusively to build a permanent dyke in front of the city, by raising the bank so as to completely protect goods, also to widen Commissioners Street and to make slopes or tunnels adjoining the harbor or the wharves, which lead thereto."" It cannot be clearly seen where these two sections may lead you. Can you, for example, widen Commissioners Street without the help of the Harbor Commission, or do they want to widen on the north side by throwing down the buildings thereon actually erected? Nothing to that effect is said. The first section of the by-law says that the million to be voted will serve to prevent floods and improve the harbor, whilst the second sections say that the million will be applied exclusively to build a permanent dyke, to widen Commissioners Street, and to build tunnels.","Can you, for example, widen Commissioners Street without the help of the Harbor Commission, or do they want to widen on the north side by throwing down the buildings thereon actually erected?

Now, according to the letter of the by-law cited above, the City Council may do the work they will judge convenient on Commissioners Street, without making the least improvement to the harbor to accommodate trade. In such a case, what do we want with a permanent dyke until the temporary one has been tried? Why should we vote for a loan of a million until we know what the Harbor Commissioners are disposed to do for the improvement of the Montreal harbor?","The barrow is equipped with cooking utensils, tinned food, and mining tools, and is constructed so that it can be turned into a sleeping compartment.

NOW THE RIVER. Saturday night's advices from down river ports were that at Three Rivers the lake ice was on the move since 2 p.m. Lachine reported a slight shove accompanied by a rise, and then a fall in the water. At Berthierville the ice was rotten and it was hoped the river would be clear by today. Looking down the river from Montreal at dusk no sign of a break-up was apparent; as far as the eye could reach was one stretch of rugged ice pack, unbroken except in one or two very small patches. Over towards St. Lambert the same view presented itself, the only extent of water visible being where Commissioners Street was five feet under water. Here the current swept along at the rate of four or five miles an hour.

At Lochumda yesterday afternoon there had been no change for the past twenty-four hours, showing clearly that the jam existed above them. The channel was one mass of solid ice, the lake ice having come down and wedged itself between the surface ice and the bottom. Behind the rubber works a heavy mass of ice had grounded on the piers, leaving an open space of three or four acres below. The Canadian Pacific Railway track was unharmed, being at the lowest point four feet above water. However, every precaution was taken and men were set to watch the track and bridges. As a matter of precaution only the inside track was used. There was absolutely no change in the ice from 2 till 10 o'clock. RELIEFS OR RELIEF.","Scientific men disagreed with the theory of Capt. Leger, who suggested that piers should be built across the river at Lachine. They believed that the council or the Government, or whoever did the work, might as well throw the money into the river as carry out the plan. Aid. Grenier: The Government will not do it. Aid. Stevenson: You cannot interfere with a navigable river without the consent of the federal Government. In the evidence obtained there is nothing that would prevent the flooding. I believe that it will yet be found necessary to raise the streets of Montreal above the level of the river and regulate the sewerage accordingly. We will have a meeting of the Inundation Committee next week and we will probably have some report to make before next council meeting. Aid. Mount gave it as his opinion that the inundation came from the clerks of the weather. (Laughter) Aid.

There was a fairly large gathering considering the snowstorm that prevailed. Mr. Savignac first addressed the meeting in French. He presented himself, he said, at the demand of a large number of voters, who thought it was time to make a change in the representation of the ward. He was sure himself that that change was needed, and if he were elected on the 1st of March, he would do all he possibly could to further their interests. He was sorry he could not address the meeting fluently in English, but he understood enough to know what was right for his electors and how to vote at the right time. Aid.

What infrastructure and political challenges are being addressed in Montreal and New Edinburgh as a result of the ice conditions and how are they being managed according to the passage?,"A Norwegian study using the explorers' ancient logbooks suggests that dramatic shrinkage of sea ice, widely cited as evidence for global warming in recent years, has occurred before. That doesn't necessarily prove that recent disappearance of sea ice is natural, but raises the possibility that it could be, researchers say. Adventurers of the 1700s, who took meticulous notes on their voyages, encountered ice conditions similar to those seen today, researcher Chad Dick said in an interview from Norway. ""If you go back to the early 1700s you find that sea ice extent was about the same then as it is now,"" said Dick of the Arctic Climate Systems Study, an international research program. In Canada there has been alarm at reduced ice cover in Hudson's Bay, which is causing problems for polar bears. There's also been debate about disappearing ice in the Northwest Passage, which could result in challenges to Canadian sovereignty over the passage. Those phenomena have been cited as evidence that humans are causing the global climate to warm. ""But similar shrinkage has occurred before, according to the Norwegian researchers who have drawn up Arctic ice charts covering 500 years.","X Fredericksburg storm's Corners Long's review The striking feature of this comparison is the vote in the town of Naimnee. Here the liberals made their chief efforts, in so far as the influence of their leaders could aid them. It was at Naimnee that Mr. Blake made his three hours' speech, a speech so important that he could not consent to divide it by permitting a reply from anyone less than a minister of the Crown, knowing that no minister of the Crown was within reach of him. That speech was expected to produce marvellous results, and the expectation has in one respect at least been realized. It converted a liberal majority of two into a conservative majority of forty-three. No more moving speech was ever made, the only trouble being that it moved people in the opposite direction from that intended. Nobody knows what might have been the result had it not been that the moving impulse was probably checked by Mr. Paterson, of Brant, who is always willing to meet his opponents on the public platform, and discuss with them, vigorously but courteously, the political issues of the day, and who addressed a meeting in the town on Tuesday afternoon.","An Hon member Yes. Sir Lkonard Tiiakv I doubt it. The country was not roused. It was not excited. Petitions, though they have been circulated by hundreds and thousands have not poured into this House in extraordinary numbers against this proposal.

""The woodlot on this farm has not been slaughtered as it has on so many of the other farms here. But the main reason I was willing to pay a premium price for this farm is because I know the land must be better. It has not been mined of its nutrients by making it grow the same crops year after year. And the soil hasn't been spoiled by lathering it with fertilizer. You know by the feel of it under your feet that it's still mellow, still unhurt by all the unnatural things that a man has to do now if he farms the modern way."" It must have given the bishop and his faithful followers quite a shock to learn that land handed over to the devil had proven more valuable than land which had been in the care of good and faithful stewards who had done their scientific utmost to produce. But quite apart from the theological puzzle that old Finlander's will must have given the bishop, it seems to me that it should have given the better minds in modern agriculture something to think about too. What is the highly mechanized, highly fertilized farming of today doing to the fundamental nature of the land itself?"

"How have the torrential weather conditions affected the buying patterns of cattle and sheep in the Liverpool area during the past week, specifically in relation to the Christmas market and the demands from London customers?","Heavy arrivals of beef from Liverpool have depressed prices in the meat markets; 1,000 State cattle realized 5¾d to 6d per lb; 80 Canadian made 5d to 6¼d. There was a fair demand for sheep, but prices were without much alteration from last week; 1,080 Canadian sheep made 5¾d per lb; Canadian lamb sold at 6d; 615 State merino sheep made 5¾d per lb. Montreal, October 4. Since our last, the demand for ocean freight has improved somewhat, especially for space to Glasgow, and the bulk of it has now been engaged for the balance of the season to the shore port at 42s 6d to 45s, but there is still considerable Liverpool and London freight on the market, and owing to the continued bad advice from the former place, skippers are somewhat disposed to hold off for the present.

The picture is so bright and cheerful one can hardly think it possible there is another side to it. And yet there is. I forbear, however, from dwelling on it, simply contenting myself by remarking that freights on United States cattle have jumped up 10s a head already, which would suggest that somebody else was going to have a bit out of the jubilee profit besides the butcher and the cattle exporter and not a little bit either."
"What specific impact did the storm have on the infrastructure at the wharf near Mr. Puize's house, and how did the old wreck of the Margaret M contribute to protecting the building?","THE SMITHFIELD SHOW: Details of Leading Markets The Putchers' Boycott Canadians at Glasgow (From our own correspondent) Liverpool, December 11 With fierce gales off the land and off the sea, with torrential showers, hail and rain almost daily, we have had a rough time of it during the past week. Business has not benefited thereby; quite the contrary. Our country markets have been filling up with cattle and sheep in anticipation of the Christmas demand, while the usual attractive shows and sales of Christmas fat stock have kept many buyers away from Birkenhead, who will, however, probably find their way back after the festive season is over. While the country demand has thus been cut off to a considerable extent, our London customers have been buying pretty strong, the supplies at Deptford for the past ten days having been below the average. The worst of this London trade, however, is they want to buy all our choice beef, and when they get served, there is some difficulty in selling out the secondary and third class bodies left. Still, things keep moving along, and salesmen would not feel comfortable if they had nothing to grumble about.","A large number of seagulls hovered round the harbour today, no doubt driven by the storm from their haunts down the river.

"What specific impacts did the storm have on infrastructure and economic loss in Trois Pistoles, and how does this compare to the damage and economic impact in L'Islet as described in the passage?","B, November 6 Information from reliable sources says that out of eight ships off Kamouroska yesterday two are missing, supposed to have lost their anchors or run for Quebec. Two schooners at the Brandy Pots broke their chains and went adrift. The old wreck of the Margaret M, which was lying about twenty yards from the house of Mr. Puize at this wharf, was washed alongside of the house, and quite likely this, with the help of some fifty men, is what saved the building. The steamer Union had a very narrow escape from being wrecked while lying at the wharf at Eboulements. The passengers were all landed at the commencement of the gale, but the cargo was more or less damaged by the rolling of the boat and the seas shipped. One schooner is aground at the wharf. WHARVES SWEPT AWAY; Trois Pistoles, Q, November 6 We suffered much damage here by the rise of water. Three yachts were partly destroyed and a schooner damaged.","He said that if a significant amount of that timber is now destroyed, the ability of the plant to operate at full capacity could be in question. It could take months to determine the full extent of fire damage, however. Within the burned area, there might well be islands of timber protected by water that were spared and other areas that were merely scorched rather than consumed. Past experience suggests that about 25 percent of the timber in the burned area could be salvaged, Labonte said. National problem Across Canada, forest fires have been an unusually serious problem this year, destroying close to 5 million hectares of forest so far, or about five times as much woodland as the one million hectares harvested for sawmills and paper plants each year, said Pierre Lachance of the Canadian Pulp and Paper Association. The economic impact is very difficult to determine because it is necessary to find out how seriously damaged the burned areas are, how much wood can be salvaged and how much of the damage will be corrected by natural regeneration, Lachance said. Another complication in doing such a calculation of economic loss from fires is that forest fires actually help regenerate some kinds of trees."," seeking to launch similar class-action suits against Shell, Kugler said, In Quebec, the Shell Canada case is expected to be heard in six months to a year, Kugler said, It costs between $100 and $300 to inspect and clean a gas tank, according to Kugler, Affected individuals should also be compensated for other costs, he added, In one case, a hunter in a remote area was stranded for two days because his car would not start, he said, Other costs might also be associated with having purchased the Shell Bronze gas, Kugler added, Car owners selling their vehicles, for example, might have to lower their prices to compensate buyers for the cost of having the tank inspected and cleaned, Anybody who bought the Bronze gas in Quebec between March 2001 and March 2002 is automatically included in the suit, Kugler said, Drivers who want to submit detailed information about their cases can do so via the Web site of law firm Kugler Kandestin (www.kugler-kandestin.com), he added, Kugler Kandestin is involved in other high-profile class-action suits, including one accusing Blockbuster Canada of charging unlawful late fees and another alleging generic drugmakers charged inflated prices, ar"

"What specific actions were taken to address the infrastructure damage caused by the washouts, and what were the immediate health impacts on the individuals involved in the incident?","Not quite, The 1993 law does not cover sex offenders who were convicted before its passage - which is to say most of those who are now at large, including Mr. Heywood, That is highly disturbing, given the proclivity of many sex offenders to repeat their offences, There is not quite a legal vacuum for pre-1993 offenders, Another Criminal Code provision allows a judge to order a convicted offender to stay away from places where children are likely to be; an application is in the works for such an order against Wray Budreo, a convicted child molester who was recently released from prison in Ontario at the end of his term, Such legal restrictions may offer only limited protection to children, They would hardly stop a determined molester from committing an offence, Still, they could help deter some crimes, Children deserve whatever protection the law can give, For all its flaws, the 1951 law seems to be better than nothing, It would have been best if the judges had kept the old law on the books until the passage of time closed the loophole opened by its demise, Failing that, perhaps the Supreme Court could have found legal grounds to keep the old law in effect for a few more years - long enough to give police and prosecutors a chance to","It is important to quote the following extract from Fuller's evidence as to an interview he had in the autumn of 1887 with the plaintiff, Bryant, to whom he admits having said, ""If I found we were in any way indebted to him we would settle it.""

Defendants' witness, Potter, says no damage was done in 1886, while Brock and Jones, while referring to both years, emphasize 1887. Harvey Stock speaks of having been engaged to run the logs at the end of April, 1887, and Courser from the 10th to the 15th of the same month.

Davitt's answer to that blow was that now he is a candidate for Waterford. O'Brien in his concluding words accused the police of using their batons more in favor of the attacking mob than otherwise. The police, he asserted, protected the Parnellites while the force of their blows was devoted to the McCarthyites. Terrible Storms in Great Britain. London, December 13.

The goal of the study was to see what are the health benefits of wearing a pedometer.","Not quite, The 1993 law does not cover sex offenders who were convicted before its passage - which is to say most of those who are now at large, including Mr. Heywood, That is highly disturbing, given the proclivity of many sex offenders to repeat their offences, There is not quite a legal vacuum for pre-1993 offenders, Another Criminal Code provision allows a judge to order a convicted offender to stay away from places where children are likely to be; an application is in the works for such an order against Wray Budreo, a convicted child molester who was recently released from prison in Ontario at the end of his term, Such legal restrictions may offer only limited protection to children, They would hardly stop a determined molester from committing an offence, Still, they could help deter some crimes, Children deserve whatever protection the law can give, For all its flaws, the 1951 law seems to be better than nothing, It would have been best if the judges had kept the old law on the books until the passage of time closed the loophole opened by its demise, Failing that, perhaps the Supreme Court could have found legal grounds to keep the old law in effect for a few more years - long enough to give police and prosecutors a chance to"
"What specific impacts on infrastructure and human health are detailed in the passage regarding the storm's effects on Leeds, Newcastle, and Elmswell?","Tucker said he arrived at this glum assessment by combining this new deforestation map with earlier studies about how disturbed habitats affect the diversity of plant and animal species. ""I want to stress that we've only estimated what it is,"" he said. Skole and Tucker reached their conclusion after using a computerized Geographic Information System to compare Landsat satellite images of the Amazon basin from 1978 and 1988. The GIS program let them estimate the annual rate of deforestation and the total loss of forested land during that decade. They then mapped isolated forest islands and estimated the land damaged by edge effects or complete isolation. Edge effects, as described by researchers who specialize in that field, were assumed to affect trees within roughly one kilometer of a forest's border. To confirm their conclusions, Compton and Skole compared a number of samples with even more detailed images from a French satellite. Then they went to Brazil to study three broad regions on the ground and compare those findings with their satellite estimates. What they learned was that 240,000 square kilometers of land have been completely shorn of trees. That is 5.6 percent of the virgin Amazon rain forest.","Their previous research has focused on magnetite in fish, insects and bacteria. Now, the Kirschvinks and their associates are trying to determine whether honeybees actually use their magnetite as an internal compass. Scientists wonder whether people also have a navigational sense that helped the Polynesians, Australian Aborigines and American Indians, for example, to pioneer new routes. Evidence that some animals sense direction by orienting themselves in Earth's magnetic field has been accumulating for decades. Northbound bacteria In 1975, a scientist discovered a group of bacteria that orient themselves in the Earth's magnetic field and always seem to swim north. Researchers found that the bacteria sensed direction by producing their own internal compasses, crystals of magnetite. Scientists soon discovered similar magnetite crystals in the heads of honeybees, abdomens of pigeons and bodies of other animals. Extremely tiny quantities of magnetite are detectable in all parts of the human brain, according to Kirschvink. But the meninges - thin membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord - contain about 20 times the average. Although the amounts of magnetite found in the human brain are small, they could be sufficient to produce an effect when the brain is exposed to strong electromagnetic fields.","Extremely tiny quantities of magnetite are detectable in all parts of the human brain, according to Kirschvink.

Possible health links These fields are invisible waves created whenever electricity passes through a wire or other conductor. Some scientists have linked exposure to such fields near high-voltage transmission lines to certain health problems. Magnetite crystals in the brain may provide the missing link needed to explain biological effects of electromagnetic fields. Until now there has been no way of explaining how such fields could possibly affect the human body, which contains no other known magnetic substance. However, Kirschvink is cautious about drawing conclusions. ""Yes, there is magnetite in human brain tissue. Yes, it is possible that the presence of magnetite may mediate any health effects of electromagnetic fields,"" he says. ""But in my opinion, the jury is definitely still out on whether electromagnetic fields actually do have health effects.""

That cold air, when it lies under a mass of warm moist air that has moved up from the Gulf of Mexico, is what makes freezing rain. And this year, thanks to the El Nino effect in the Pacific Ocean, we can expect more freezing rain than usual, said Lawrence Mysak, a professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences at McGill University and past president of the Canadian Academy of Sciences. Yesterday's storm, which dumped about 23 millimetres of freezing rain at Dorval airport, was about the fourth or fifth worst storm on record, Pommainville said. The worst was Feb. 25, 1961, when 21.5 millimetres fell in one 24-hour period, leading to an ice coating 3 centimetres thick."," sidewalk and blocking the intersection for hours Then a van rear-ended the bus In Dorval, Donald Richard (right) borrowed a cell phone from a fellow commuter to call his boss after spending more than two hours in a traffic jam There were 125 accidents reported on highways around the island of Montreal by noon and the Sureté du Québec said that more than 200 cars had slid off roads ""They were mostly accidents with only minor damage All of the highways were a problem this morning,"" said SQ spokesman Constable Mathias Tellier On the South Shore, road conditions were so bad that by about 9 a.m., passengers on one bus that had already been stopped for about 40 minutes simply gave up With no idea how much longer the delay could last and only bad news about the road conditions ahead, the driver stopped along the shoulder of Highway 116 in Saint-Bruno and asked his 49 passengers what they wanted to do The driver, who didn't want to give his name, said: ""I asked them, 'Does anyone still want to go to Montreal?'"
"How did the ice storm specifically impact transportation infrastructure in Quebec, as mentioned in the passage?","These payments for lodging and spoiled food and repairs to homes, businesses, farms and vehicles are expected to reach $1.5 billion all told in Quebec and Ontario. More than $1 billion of that will go into Quebec, and $700 million of it into Montreal, the insurers said. ""The amount of money flowing into the Montreal economy, we estimate, has not flowed in such a short period of time in such magnitude since the 1976 Olympics, and it dwarfs the last big project built in Montreal, the Molson Centre, which was $230 million,"" said George Anderson, president of the Insurance Bureau of Canada. ""If you look at the economic statistics coming out of Quebec in the last little while you'll see the economy is up a bit, and we think these payments had something directly to do with that."" The property and casualty insurance companies held a press conference to highlight their response to the ice storm, promote their product, and point out that the economy did indeed get a shot in the arm. ""It was a major disaster for the people of Quebec - but it was also a major boost laterally for the Quebec economy,"" Anderson said.","Until the English language, English habits of thought, English literature MAN MACDONALD on the Tories ""The topics of the ads reveal a welcome shift of emphasis from divisive issues."" When a leader is in trouble, it's a good idea to surround him with the team as the Conservatives have done with Stephen Harper in a series of four television ads that have been running since late August in Battleground Ontario. The 30-second spots might not succeed in changing voters' minds about Harper, but they might create a comfort level with the Conservative team. The Team Tory theme also plays to competence, another key attribute that moves voters. The topics of the ads reveal a welcome shift of emphasis from divisive issues like same-sex marriage. Of the four spots, only one, on taxes, is a core Conservative message to the party's base. The others - on accrediting immigrants' professional skills, child care and health care - are aimed at broadening the Conservatives' appeal in urban Ontario. While the ads aren't running in Quebec, they can be viewed at the party's website (www.conservative.ca), which is a story in itself. The Tories","The Fondation de la Faune du Quebec is publishing a guide for homeowners that offers tips to make backyards and city parks more bird-friendly. ""The ice storms were devastating, but we're hoping that people will use them as a way to change their backyards to encourage more kinds of birds to live there,"" said Bernard Beaudin, the foundation's president. ""We think that will give people a better quality of life."" In a joint project with Hydro-Quebec, the foundation is spending $500,000 on an ""After the Ice"" program, which includes the publication next month of the homeowners' guide, as well as offering seminars and manuals for the people who design and maintain public parks. Thousands of free guides will be distributed in May, while the seminars for park managers will be held at the end of April. Luc-Alain Giraldeau, a Concordia University behavioural ecologist, said the storms did affect some birds in the Montreal area. Most birds that stay here during the winter rely on humans for food, so as long as the bird feeders were full, most survived. But one kind of bird in particular had a hard time."

How did the freezing conditions specifically impact the Montreal South Shore Transit Corp.'s bus services during the afternoon rush hour?,"Season's first big snowfall hits the city MIKE KING THE GAZETTE The first substantial snowfall of the season claimed one life in the Montreal area yesterday. A 19-year-old Montreal man was killed when his car rammed into a snowplow clearing the express lane of Highway 40 near the Assumption Blvd. exit in Repentigny, the Surete du Quebec reported. Police withheld his name. The accident occurred around 12:40 p.m. Spokesmen for both the provincial and Montreal Urban Community police said there were no other serious traffic accidents due to the early morning snow accumulation. Renel Lagace of the Dorval Weather Office said 8 to 10 centimetres of snow and hail fell on the region between 4 a.m. and noon. Drivers then had to contend with freezing rain and ice pellets. While motorists weathered the storm with relative ease, commuters dependent on public transit literally found themselves out in the cold. Pierre Desjardins, director of client services for the Laval Transit Corp., said 20 per cent of the bus routes were cancelled because of icy bridge conditions while buses on the remaining runs were delayed by 45 to 50 minutes.","Hint 487-5545 DRAKES WHEEL ALIGNMENT TUNE-UP Hi CENTRE DUM on Ah Lta mm du Golf St-Charles BIGGEST CHRISTMAS SALE EVER LE CENTRE DU GOLF ST-CHARLES INC T T "" T V t, (J: ""Hi f jet 3 I' f v - f GAZETTE ALLEN McINNIS Simone Santurru shows good technique in scraping ice off car yesterday during the season's first snowstorm Season's first big snowfall hits the city MIKE KING THE GAZETTE The first substantial snowfall of the season claimed one life in the Montreal area yesterday A 19-year-old Montreal man was killed when his car rammed into a snowplow clearing the express lane of Highway 40 near the Assumption Blvd exit in Repentigny, the Sureté du Québec reported Police withheld his name The accident occurred around 12:40 p.m Spokesmen for both the provincial and Montreal Urban Community police said there were no other serious traffic accidents due to the early morning snow accumulation Renel Lagace of the Dorval Weather Office said 8 to 10 centimetres of snow and hail fell on the region between 4 a.m and noon","Today's fleet of 435 buses is 56 percent larger than in 1981 but the number of users is up 108 per cent for the same 10 years.

We need a Metro by the year 2000, Aubertin stressed. In the meantime, South Shore residents will have to depend on a new bridge-tunnel link scheduled to open in the spring of 1993. The provincial government plans to build a 1.4-kilometre-long tunnel for buses and cyclists under the St. Lawrence Seaway which will join the existing ice bridge that protects the Champlain Bridge. South Shore transit users will soon have at least 13 new bus shelters courtesy of the union which left an estimated 50,000 regular bus riders stranded in freezing cold more than two years ago."

Although he typically has a full legal plate, Binnie has made time for gardening, skiing and sailing. He is invariably described as kind and personable, but not to be taken lightly in the courtroom. A colleague remembers a 1992 boundary dispute with France in which Binnie, representing Ottawa, boiled down a confusing point into an amusing analogy about a joint bank account. The story not only clearly explained the point, but had the French lawyer and the judge in gales of laughter, recalls the associate. ""Not an easy thing to do. It's certainly one of the key features of his approach to difficult issues, to get at the essence of them and to express that in very simple, very matter-of-fact but very persuasive language."" Binnie was often called in to rescue floundering cases on appeal - for example, last year he persuaded the Supreme Court to let three Nazi war-crimes cases proceed despite a secret meeting between a judge and a senior federal lawyer. ""He's one of the best lawyers in Canada and he's the kind of person we need on the Supreme Court of Canada,"" said Osgoode Hall law professor Patrick Monahan.","He is invariably described as kind and personable, but not to be taken lightly in the courtroom.

"What specific emotional and ecological impacts did the storm have on the individuals visiting Mount Royal, as described in the passage?","The swamp was to be a basin surrounded by a tree-lined avenue, Bumbaru says. Instead, it was excavated in 1937 and a drainage system and concrete walls were built to create a lake. Workers found evidence of an old beaver dam; hence the name Beaver Lake. It would be wasteful to try to make anything else than a mountain of it, Olmsted cautioned Montrealers in his 1881 book called Mount Royal. Olmsted, Bumbaru says, intended the paths to be accessible to the weak and the aged as much as anyone else. Olmsted was not creating an environmental enclave in the city, but creating an urban park with the mountain. Decarie takes it a step farther. Olmsted wasn't a conservationist, he says flatly. He was a social reformer, a democrat. Yet a century after the democratic revolution at Mount Royal, the 100th anniversary of its creation was ignored, Guilbault says. City officials must have been preoccupied with another monument, the Olympic Stadium being erected for the 1976 Olympics.","But that was three better than the 78 strokes Arnold Palmer required in the chilly weather and occasional showers.

How did the ice storm in Ottawa impact the operations of federal government agencies and what actions did the local and federal authorities take in response to the situation?,"""If you include it, it is over a billion dollars,"" Brassard said of the total storm damage in the province. ""We are requesting that the federal government consider these damages as being admissible for compensation within the framework of its aid program,"" the Quebec minister said. A spokesman for Brassard, Marie Vaillant, stressed that the $1 billion-plus figure that Quebec has put on the table in negotiations is based on early estimates because all the bills for losses are not yet in. Just how Quebec estimates the $1 billion has never been specified in detail. Brassard figures the bill for other damages and for emergency services could be as much as $400 million, and he wants Ottawa to cover up to 90 per cent under the federal Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements and other special measures. Ottawa has already advanced $50 million to Quebec, and $25 million to Ontario, under the DFAA, as well as making $25 million available to Quebec, and $10 million to Ontario, $5 million to New Brunswick, under the Employment Insurance program. These funds would be used to pay wages for unemployed workers to clean up debris. The DFAA covers mainly uninsurable capital losses suffered by individuals but not by big corporations like Hydro-Quebec.","The high-profile lawyer, who converted from separatism last year, said, ""We believe it's necessary to measure the will to live together,"" Bertrand said he's convinced that less than 40 per cent of Quebecers really want sovereignty even though 49.4 per cent of those who cast ballots in the referendum last Oct. 30 were ""tricked"" into voting Yes, ""And I believe that the majority of Canadians are ripe to recognize Quebec as a distinct society,"" he told a news conference yesterday, Bertrand has launched a court case aimed at having last year's referendum process declared illegal, He has also formed a federalist movement called Citizens for a Democratic Nation, which he claims is attracting 500 new members a week, Bertrand said Premier Lucien Bouchard will never succeed in uniting Quebecers behind his push to revitalize the economy until he gives up the idea of unilateral separation from Canada, Krever puts Ottawa on notice CANADIAN PRESS TORONTO - Former federal health ministers failed to provide ""national leadership"" to deal with the crisis of Canadians infected with tainted blood, says a document obtained by The Canadian Press, ""Efforts to prevent or mitigate contamination were delayed and inconsistent,"" says a notice Justice Horace Krever sent to the","Most of those who escaped from the prison in Gomez Palacio apparently were serving time for drug crimes or robbery, though a few had been sentenced for kidnapping, newspapers reported.

The trial continues today. The company announced in a terse statement that it would shut down operations at the mill as of March 20. It did not say whether the closing would be permanent, and company officials were unavailable for comment. At least 365 mill workers would lose their jobs. More than a thousand other jobs in woodland operations and related businesses could also be wiped out. The New Brunswick government, the city of Bathurst and unions said they were shocked by the company's decision to walk away from the mill after failing to gain concessions from workers. Stone-Consolidated, a subsidiary of the Chicago-based Stone Container Inc., wanted, among other things, a 20-per-cent reduction in wages, including cancellation of a negotiated 5.5-per-cent increase due on June 28. The workers refused. In Fredericton, the provincial government promised to do all it can to keep the mill going."

One twister followed a path that started 55 kilometres east of Edmonton and tracked northeast. The other hit just east of Falun, a village 75 kilometres southwest of Edmonton. The Sportsman Motor Inn and an Alberta Wheat Pool grain elevator in Smoky Lake, about 70 km northeast of Edmonton, were extensively damaged by another tornado early yesterday morning. Tim Aldie of Environment Canada said yet another tornado may have tracked up toward the Lac La Biche - Fort McMurray area.

After waddling down Ste Catherine without slipping on the icy sidewalk, caused by more than 7 millimetres of freezing rain that fell on the city, he was rewarded by being doused in slush by a passing car. ""It's hell,"" said Paradis, 34. The slush was caused when 4 centimetres of snow that fell early yesterday melted after temperatures climbed following a southwesterly flow of warm air, said Chantal Mathieu of Environment Canada. The high temperature in Montreal yesterday was 2 degrees Celsius. Paradis wasn't alone in his misery as pedestrians in and around the city had the perilous task of navigating sidewalks after freezing rain fell for the second time in less than three weeks.

In total, 7.3 millimetres of freezing rain fell in Montreal, while Saint-Hubert on the South Shore was hit with 9.6 millimetres. On Feb. 9, Montreal was hit with about 5 millimetres of freezing rain. As well, winds gusting up to 60 kilometres an hour made being outdoors even more miserable yesterday. Several downtown streets were littered with abandoned umbrellas, bent out of shape by sudden gusts of wind. The freezing rain also caused major headaches for motorists as the Surete du Quebec reported dozens of accidents and pileups after drivers lost control of their vehicles. No one was killed, said Constable Gerard Carrier of the Surete. As well, Transport Quebec was forced to close several highways as strong winds drastically reduced visibility on roads across the province. The strong winds and freezing rain also wreaked havoc on Hydro-Quebec power lines as more than 11,000 clients lost electricity yesterday. On Montreal Island, most of the blackouts were centred in St Leonard and the St Michel district of Montreal. All of the clients had their power restored by yesterday evening, Hydro officials said."

The so-called data assembled in an EA are so limited in scale, scope and duration as to be virtually worthless scientifically. At the very least, an EA should be initiated from a profound sense of humility at the inadequacy of our knowledge. At best, the EA can highlight questions, reveal areas of ignorance and warn of potentially sensitive effects. Anyone who claims to know enough to predict with confidence the consequences of new developments simply doesn't understand the limited nature of scientific knowledge.","Alcohol from a mouthwash dissipates within a couple of minutes and guidelines state that a suspect has to be observed for several minutes before a breathalyzer test is undertaken. Is it surprising that people resort to such curious acts when they've overindulged? Not really. After all, alcohol certainly affects the brain. And the rest of the body as well. The chemistry involved is fascinating. Of course, before alcohol can affect the brain, it has to get there. Most of the alcohol we consume is absorbed into the bloodstream from the stomach and the small intestine. But not all of the alcohol makes it through. Some is metabolized in the mucosa that lines the stomach and intestine. Here, enzymes convert ethanol first to acetaldehyde and then to acetic acid, neither of which is inebriating. In men, about 30 per cent of a dose of alcohol meets its metabolic end in this fashion, but there is a definite gender bias here. The female stomach and intestinal lining is only about half as efficient at breaking down ethanol, so more makes it into the circulation. This explains why women can become tipsy more easily. Once the alcohol is in the bloodstream, it passes through the liver."

"How is the political climate in Kenya, influenced by the drought and economic conditions, affecting the country's relationship with Western aid donors, and what specific political and economic reforms are being demanded by these donors?","Mr. Moi has long used the prospect of inter-tribal warfare as an argument for maintaining a one-party state. But according to many credible observers, including Kenya's Roman Catholic bishops, the violence is hardly spontaneous. They accuse the authorities of fomenting the violence, which seems to have been sparked by members of Mr. Moi's small Kalenjin tribe who attacked members of the Luo and Luhya tribes. Many prominent members of the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy, the major opposition group, are Luos or Luhyas. Mr. Moi seems to be looking for an excuse to delay holding multi-party elections indefinitely. Presumably, he fears he would lose. In addition to banning political meetings, the authorities have resumed their old habit of cracking down on public protests. Earlier this month, police viciously attacked a group of women hunger strikers and their supporters in a Nairobi park. Several were badly beaten, including Wangari Maathai, 53, a prominent environmentalist and opposition supporter (but not one of the hunger strikers), who was knocked unconscious. The hunger strikers, who are calling for the release of their sons in prison on what they say are politically motivated treason charges, have since taken sanctuary in a church.","In addition to banning political meetings, the authorities have resumed their old habit of cracking down on public protests.

""Germany is Poland's most important partner."" The treaty marked a milestone in relations between the two countries. Germany invaded Poland in 1939, at the start of World War II, and the death toll in Poland reached the millions. Germany's Chancellor Helmut Kohl referred to ""the suffering of the past,"" and pledged himself to ""the promotion of understanding and reconciliation."" The treaty commits Germany to help Poland win membership in the European Community, and to help resolve problems created by Poland's heavy foreign debt. There was no explicit promise of German economic aid for Poland. But the political climate in Germany favors such aid. Some Germans oppose the treaty because it guarantees the existing Polish-German border. Poland received a large swath of German land at the end of World War II, and millions of Germans were expelled from their land. The pact guarantees the rights of Poland's 200,000 ethnic Germans."

Norway - with its 81 years of life expectancy and average annual income of $58,810 - has now topped the Human Development Index (HDI) for all but two years since 2001. It does not top any individual category - average income in Liechtenstein is a wallet-busting $81,011 and Japan's life expectancy is 83.6 years - but Norway's all-round performance gave it superiority in the UN Development Program (UNDP) 20th annual rankings. Australia, New Zealand, the United States and Ireland followed at the top of the standings. Canada placed No. 8. Zimbabwe came in last among the 169 nations ranked, behind Mozambique, Burundi, Niger and the Democratic Republic of Congo. In Zimbabwe life expectancy is only 47 years and per capita income is $176.

How has the conflict between Zimbabwe's Grain Marketing Board and the National Railway affected the economic situation regarding maize distribution during the drought?,"Tanzania has also been severely afflicted and on Wednesday the United Nations said that Kenya in East Africa faces famine. The two countries where starvation has been common for more than a decade, Mozambique and Angola, have had good rains and good crops. But famine in those countries has been caused mainly by prolonged civil wars and the problem will be getting food to the people who need it. The United Nations estimates 500,000 people face starvation in Mozambique's central provinces. Charles Bassett, the Canadian high commissioner in Zimbabwe, said Thursday that people are already dying in Zimbabwe as a result of malnutrition. And the worst is yet to come. The dry season is at its peak in July and August and the already critical water shortage will become dire, Bassett said. Already there are many communities that are 40 kilometres from the nearest water. It is going to be a massive task to take water to isolated communities, he said. The Zimbabwe government has a $40-million plan to buy 600 water tankers and to drill 2,600 holes but it's uncertain the plan can be activated quickly enough. The crisis has led to corruption, profiteering and petty jealousies between government departments throughout the region.","The United Nations estimates 500,000 people face starvation in Mozambique's central provinces.

In both cases the officials claimed the trucks were overloaded.

It is now conceded that the majority of our prevailing diseases, including consumption (that spectre of every northern fireside) are more or less closely associated with failure of the digestive process otherwise what we familiarly call indigestion or dyspepsia. Now, as the digestion of food is, beyond question, the superlative function performed within the human body, illness in various forms must result from any imperfection in it, as death rapidly follows upon its complete arrest. It would seem a rational conclusion that any hope of finding a preventive of disease must be founded upon our knowledge of how to control the digestion and maintain it in normal health and vigor indefinitely. On no other theory can we expect to see men die of old age only."

While in Minnesota, Dakota and Nebraska the railways are blocked with snow and occasionally at intervals with stalled and broken engines, along the line of the Canadian Pacific trains are running on time, the weather is calm and fine, and the temperature from Winnipeg westward varies from 15° to 4° above zero.","Oh, in the total, these values are made up from the June schedules of farmers.

We objected, from a Canadian standpoint, to the policy of the St. Paul and Manitoba Railway; and we have nothing whatever to withdraw in our remarks upon that subject. But their policy was a policy dictated by their own interests, not by Canadian interests, and our regret was that Canadians, especially Mr. Donald A.

We know that they require warmth for their development. The influence of cold is shown in the following instance: In 1893 a ship from Liverpool bound for Philadelphia was attacked with cholera. On the day on which the greatest number of new cases and deaths occurred, a large iceberg came in sight, lowering the temperature many degrees; from that time the cholera on board ceased. No more cases occurred. Its prevalence in northern climates may be explained as follows: The intense cold of the winter compels the inhabitants to heat their houses by every possible means, preventing ventilation, while the atmosphere within them is kept at high temperature by huge stoves; the imported germs find here the conditions favorable for their development. Many of the poorer classes use snow water, and as the snow about the houses receives all refuse matters, portions of cholera excreta may thus gain an entrance into the system through the drinking water.","""Reef-building corals depend on a symbiotic relationship with algae that live inside their bodies and provide them with vital nutrients. When coral animals are stressed by something in the environment, they expel the algae and become transparent, making their underlying limestone skeleton visible. Stark white patches appear on the reefs, which get their normal green, gold, and brown hues from the algae. Once a severe bleaching episode kills the coral animals on the reef, marine scientists say that it can take the reef up to a century to recover. The researchers said widespread destruction of Caribbean reefs would, in turn, destroy the region's diverse marine life, wiping out reef-based fisheries, increasing the danger from hurricane-driven waves and crippling the vital tourist industry, Goreau, a researcher with the Discovery Bay Marine Laboratory in Jamaica, has been working with the United Nations Centre for Science and Technology for Development on evaluating global climate change. He said he was among the skeptics when colleagues suggested two years ago that widespread coral bleaching that appeared in 1987 might be a sign of global warming. He was not convinced that the bleaching was due at all to temperature, which was just one or two degrees above normal, rather than to disease, pollution or other possible causes."

OSMAN, 18, Henry Street Fortunes in Mining, (Denver Republican, September 1) Mack, Flood and Coprien made their fortunes in the Cripple Creek. They made them through knowledge of the values of the greatest district followed by purchases of stocks when the price was low. Their fortunes were enormous. It would sound like a tale of Arabian Nights for a poor man to predict that he would realize anything like such fortune in a similar way. But it was impossible. A man named Barnalo did it in the Cripple Creek district; other men made similar fortunes in the mines of the same county. Cripple Creek is as great as the Comstock; it is taken as a whole, greater than the Comstock. What the merits of Cripple Creek's greatness are, no man can say. No man can look into the solid rocks. No man can say whether this mine or that prospecting, or some trivial tract of virgin ground, will or will not prove bounteous. But fortunes have already been made in Cripple Creek, and it is probable that others will be made in the future.","The road which winds through the hilly Laurentian park is heavily traveled by trucks and swept by wild weather. Blowing snow and icy pavement make it particularly scary in winter. Between 1994 and 2001 there were more than 2,000 accidents on the highway causing 43 deaths and 100 serious injuries. Local leaders say the difficult conditions on the road have also put a brake on the region's economy which suffers from one of the worst unemployment problems in the country. Last month the jobless rate in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region stood at 12.2 per cent compared with 8.7 per cent for Quebec as a whole. Companies that depend on trucking and tourism will be prime beneficiaries of a safer more dependable link to larger population centres.

Sometimes tracks could be cleared (though only slowly) by attaching several locomotives to a train. The locomotives then combined their strength in rushes at the snow piles on the track. This method of snow removal had risks of its own. One of the locomotives might be derailed. Passengers then had to wait still longer until new equipment could be brought to the scene to get the derailed engine back on the track. Problems often increased before the winter was over. Snow was not blown away after storms, but only pressed aside by the plows on the locomotives. Tracks became deep trenches. Drifting snow, carried by strong winds over fields, dropped down into these trenches, filling them until they were worse than ever. Train travel in winter was likely to be prolonged and erratic. No traveller could know when he might reach his destination. Trains ran out of food and fuel during the delays; cars became icy-cold. Passengers might find themselves hungry and shivering."

"What specific agricultural impact did the recent floods have on farming districts in the German Empire, as described in the passage?","In the census of 1871 not a single fine was inflicted under the penal clauses of the Act of Parliament relating to the census. The present census of Great Britain will be of unusual interest, since it will definitely determine the movement of population during a period in which severe competition with America has been experienced. Between 1861 and 1871, the population of the Kingdom increased 2,300,000 or 600,000 more than in the previous decade, and this augmentation was caused primarily by the falling off of emigration to the United States in consequence of the civil war which prevailed in that country. But since 1871 the tide of emigration to the United States has set in with unparalleled vigor, and in spite of the battle breeder, he was calculating. Now manufactories have shown a better condition of the market. The New York Tribune reports that the manufacturers have increased their purchasing power. The present census shows as large a gain as the Canadians. The agricultural population has undoubtedly decreased, and the manufacturing districts have also been established. The demand made upon them will be particularly gratifying. As to the two new cotton mills, those of the census of 1871, the result will be particularly gratifying in the manufacturing mills and hosiery factories.","Although the main Forget residence in Senneville - still known as Chateau Forget - was sold separately, the structures on the site include several designed or renovated by William S. and Edward Maxwell, architects of several important buildings, including the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts and many residences of the Golden Square Mile. Descendants of Forget sold the property at a reduced price to the regional government because the MUC promised to maintain the property as green space. To plan the future of the property, the MUC established an advisory committee made up of local residents and representatives of the agriculture industry. Pierre Dansereau, Quebec's foremost ecologist and one of our most innovative thinkers, was also on the committee. The landscape-architecture firm of Williams, Asselin, Ackaoui et Associés was commissioned to study the property. Vincent Asselin was project director for an impressive array of studies. They discovered that the Bois de la Roche property forms a complex landscape that documents the evolution of farming in Quebec. Senator Forget used the property as a weekend and summer home. Business interests, such as his stock brokerage, membership on the CPR board of directors and co-founding Montreal Light, Heat & Power, kept him in town during the week.","Vincent Asselin was project director for an impressive array of studies.

Business interests, such as his stock brokerage, membership on the CPR board of directors and co-founding Montreal Light, Heat & Power, kept him in town during the week. Nevertheless, he nurtured his farm and pioneered large-scale, mechanized agriculture. Forget prepared only some of his fields for farm machinery. For that reason, hedgerows still divide the western portion of the land into small fields. From the start, MUC advisers agreed that the land should be retained as open space. Still, the question of how recreational and agricultural uses could coexist remained. Oddly, according to Asselin's research, almost all agricultural museums in North America focus on farm machinery or on re-enactments of early subsistence farming. Few places explain the development of 19th- and 20th-century farming to children and adults. For many years, there have been proposals to establish a farming museum in Quebec. The most recent suggestion was for a site on the Notre Dame."

The panel, appointed by former prime minister Brian Mulroney, made 494 recommendations to further women's equality and eliminate tolerance for violence against women. Mary Collins, the federal women's minister, said the government would implement a policy and philosophy of zero tolerance for violence. But Collins would not promise to spend any new money on the problem and she played down the fact that the report recommended a number of policies her government has rejected or cut. Those policies include a national child-care program, core funding for women's shelters, sexual-assault centres and women's organizations, a program to fund court challenges by women fighting for equality rights and mandatory violence sensitivity training for judges. Our record is not bad, said Collins. But Mary Clancy, Liberal MP and critic for women's issues, said the report's recommendations aren't new, aren't specific enough and aren't based on hard data. Many contradict current government policy. I'd toss the report out the window, said Clancy."

The lumber, mining and shipping interests of the Pacific coast have all shown life and steady progress. The fisheries have advanced even more notably, there being a regular boom in the salmon canning industry. The only serious drawback, and as Mr. Prior pointed out, it is one which has well nigh exhausted the patience of those concerned, is the complicated state of the sealing question. In no respect has the progress of the Northwest been more gratifying than in the extension of its railways and the inception of new lines in various directions. Since 1882 so much activity has not been witnessed. On no less than seven lines has construction been going on in Manitoba, besides two in the Territories. Fifty miles of new road connect Winnipeg and Portage la Prairie, and 145 have been built from Morris to Brandon, through the centre of the Province.

Crops a Total Failure Drought General and Devastating, and Everything Mortgaged Sad Pictures. St. Paul, Minn., October 22. Suffering among the settlers of Northwestern Minnesota and Western Dakota has become so widespread that it has been decided to appeal to the principal cities of the Union for aid to get them through the winter. The Chamber of Commerce of St. Paul this morning opened a subscription list and appointed a committee to visit all business houses generally and ask for liberal subscriptions of cash and supplies for these people. The relief committee of the chamber has been directed to invite all church organizations to take up a special contribution on Sunday, November, to be devoted to alleviating this distress.

It appears to have been generally successful where grown. Beans The bean crop has felt the effects of drought severely, and the returns are very variable. Where produced in eastern localities, it appears to have yielded better than in the western counties. Clover seed A very large proportion of the clover crop was winter-killed, and drought has so injured the second crop that very little seed has been secured. The midge has also proved destructive in many neighborhoods. Potatoes The potato crop is for the most part of excellent quality, having been housed in sound condition and free from disease, except in a few localities where the rot has appeared which in some cases attacked the crop after it was taken up. The plant has been remarkably free from injury from insect pests. The effect of the drought in numerous neighborhoods has been seriously to diminish the yield. Turnips The drought has seriously injured the turnips in common with other crops, and the yield as a rule has been light in all sections. Mangels The yield of mangels has been on the whole satisfactory, more especially in the Lake Erie counties."

"How did anchor ice specifically impact the milling operations in Minneapolis according to the passage, and what measures were taken to mitigate this issue?","Dombusch says that the total output of wheat in the Province of Buenos Aires, in 1895, was equal to 20,000,000 bushels, and, before the rains, a larger crop was anticipated this year, but the damage resulting from the wet weather has reduced the estimate. The Modern Miller says: The condition of the growing winter wheat plant has improved during the week. The extent of this improvement is described by the distribution of moisture, which includes rain in the Ohio Valley, snow in Eastern and Southern Nebraska, Southern Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas, extending to Northern Oklahoma and Arkansas. The Pacific coast has again been visited by heavy rains, the drought in that region being effectually broken, and the winter wheat crop outlook greatly improved. The demand for winter wheat has increased very rapidly throughout the winter wheat milling region. The demand for wheat from the Pacific Coast for Australia and South Africa continues as urgent as ever. Those points have already taken over 50,000 tons from San Francisco, and our advices state that the demand from Cape Town and Sydney will, apparently, require as much more.

Congdon & Co., of Chicago, write as follows under date of February 18: Wheat was firm but not active early, but later in the day became decidedly weak, with the help of bearish announcements by Bradstreet, and from the Northwest, and closed, with the bears in control, at the lowest point reached on the decline. There was a heavy amount of trading at the high and low prices of the day, sellers in both instances being almost wholly of short wheat, and the amount of long wheat dislodged during the day was insignificant. Cables were indifferent, the only decisive announcements of the day being Bradstreet's estimate of an increase in the world's available supply of 1,100,000 bushels, and the announcement from Minneapolis that several mills were closing down. Also that receipts would increase, owing to the price of cash wheat advancing to within of May. Why cash wheat should bring May price with the mills closing down, and larger receipts in prospect, no one has risen to explain. The milling demand here for winter wheat continues excellent, over 100,000 bushels being taken again today, in small lots to go in all directions."
"What impact would a hard freeze likely have on the water supply mentioned in the passage, and how might that affect the current operations of the mill using steam power?","Here the ice grounds in the fall, layering jamming over layer until the channel is completely blocked, and the mass of water thrown over to the north shore. I have seen in the fall and winter, when the water was high, a current of eight or nine miles an hour over the wharves. Your engineer, I feel confident could discover the cause of this and point out the remedy. Seventh, high water in the harbour is now caused by the ice jamming on Boucherville Islands. A cake gets aground on the low point of some island, another slides up over it and the jam increases until there not being sufficient outlet for the great volume of water, it is backed up into the harbour. By my plan of piers there would not be enough ice passing down to create a jam. Several years ago I made those recommendations to the Board, but no notice was taken of them. I now submit them again, as I think by these inexpensive means the present great inconvenience could be removed. I remain, Your obedient servant, C. L. Armstrong.","By my plan of piers there would not be enough ice passing down to create a jam. Several years ago I made those recommendations to the Board, but no notice was taken of them. I now submit them again, as I think by these inexpensive means the present great inconvenience could be removed. I remain, Your obedient servant, C. L. Armstrong. After some further conversation, Mr. Shearer said that any shoving of the ice in the river below Montreal would have nothing to do with his plan, and if Laprairie were affected it would be equally so without it. Anything that took place at Boucherville would not be caused by his plan. Mr. Gould observed that according to the plan the harbour would be made like a mill pond. If it were a mill pond it would freeze sooner than it did in Lake St. Louis. What would be the effect of that? Mr. Shearer replied, ""It will not freeze here at any time because the current will be so strong."" Mr. Hall remembered an occasion in 1862 when the water rose to a height of 35 feet.","The two freight sheds of the Richelieu & Ontario Navigation Company on the lower canal basin, which have stood there uninjured for fifteen years, were demolished, the supports having been cut away. The stores in the vicinity of the pool which lies from St Ann's market, up St Peter and along St Paul street were totally unapproachable, except for people who had provided themselves with long rubber boots. Many of the firms had to get the ice chopped away before they could get the doors opened, and even then a layer of ice from six inches to a foot deep was found on most of the floors. This practically puts a stop to business in this locality. At the Bonaventure depot the tracks are submerged, and all the cellars in the vicinity inundated. The YMCA for steam heating. One of Mr Lewis' great show bottles burst, owing to its contents getting frozen. The rise in the water has caused some anxiety regarding the water supply. The water having backed up the tail race, the water wheels have stopped and the city is depending entirely upon the steam engine for the supply and these are unable to keep the water in the reservoirs up to the normal. Consequently it is incumbent on householders to save the water as much as possible."

GREENHOUSE CASES Scientists to Ottawa: Act now MARGARET MUNRO CANWEST NEWS SERVICE Scientists have turned up the heat on the Harper government and are calling for urgent action on climate change. ""We must act responsibly. We must act now. We must act in concert with other industrialized nations,"" leaders of organizations representing more than 3,000 scientists said in an open letter to parliamentarians yesterday. They note that the ""eyes of the world will be on Canada"" at the international climate talks in Copenhagen and urge the government to negotiate an outcome that will rapidly and adequately address climate change. The letter is signed by the presidents of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society, the Canadian Geophysical Union, the Canadian Association of Physicists, the Canadian Society of Soil Science and the Canadian Society of Zoologists. They represent more than 3,000 researchers. Many are also federal scientists, including oceanographer Bill Crawford, president of the Canadian Meteorological and Oceanographic Society and a senior researcher at Fisheries and Oceans Canada. Crawford said the unprecedented letter grew out of the increasing alarm about the lack of concrete action.","""The key recommendation resulting from this study is that an effective adaptation plan be developed to reduce population health risks resulting from climate change,"" the team concluded. Such warning systems as the extreme heat alert system now operating in Toronto and some other cities can be lifesavers for the elderly and very young, who are most vulnerable to the lethal effects of pollution and heat, Auld said. The study builds on earlier work done by Toronto Public Health and the Ontario Medical Association. The association has estimated 1,900 premature deaths in Ontario each year are triggered by acute exposure to ozone and fine particles that waft into the air and get trapped in the lungs, with more than $1 billion in direct costs to Ontario's medical system. The new report took a much closer look at weather, pollution and death records, and it expanded the analysis into Montreal. Federal climatologists Chad Cheng, Qian Li and Guilong Li did the bulk of the number crunching over three years. They combed through Statistics Canada mortality records dating back to 1953, as well as the detailed meteorological and pollution data from the four cities dating back to 1974. They found clear links between mortality and extreme heat, cold and air pollution going back decades."

Boston, August 1 There was a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce yesterday to consider the proposed order of the Secretary of the United States Treasury, relative to the using of the cars of Canadian railroad companies to and from the United States. Hon. Alden Speare occupied the chair, and made a few opening remarks, in the course of which he said there were five Canadian roads wholly owned in the United States, and that any action taken by the United States against Canadian cars would adversely affect them. Mr. Edward Kemblin, then presenting resolutions which had been drawn up, said that they did not go to the bottom of the subject, and that they only looked to deferring action till the Interstate Commerce Commission had reported to the Senate.","This was the lowest ever known here, the previous being 9 1/2 degrees. Street thermometers record 10 and 12 below, and this temperature, accompanied by a wind which showed a velocity of 13 miles an hour, made the cold almost unbearable. Great suffering was reported to the police early in the day and prompt measures were taken for relief. Fifteen and a half below is reported from Anniston, Alabama. IN BOSTON Boston, Mass., February 13 There a regular old-fashioned snowstorm which has been raining throughout New England since early Sunday morning increased in intensity today and by night had developed into a blizzard with the usual accompaniment of stalled railroad trains, paralyzed streetcars and a general blockade. The storm, following the severe cold wave of last week, seems to have been a fitting climax for the severest weather that has been experienced in this region for many years. The main storm began at an early hour this morning and since then it has snowed incessantly, while the northwest gale at times reached a velocity of over 60 miles an hour. The steam railway companies wrestled all day with great drifts but by night the train service was practically suspended throughout New England."

What specific health risk does the passage mention for anglers exposed to the wind-chill on the ice of Montreal-area waters?,"Automobile access to the ice is generally by way of an access ramp created and maintained by the outfitter, usually across his own property. Hence the outfitter has every right to impose a toll on all cars going on the ice; prices range from $2 per vehicle to the same amount per person in the vehicle. Most outfitters sell bait at the access ramp. If you're fully equipped, the access fee and the cost of the minnows is all you'll have to pay. On the other hand, if you rent cabins, figure on the daily rental fee and, in some cases, rentals of tip-ups and a fee for drilling the holes. The advantage of renting an ice-fishing cabin is that you have a warm shelter from the cold and the wind, an important consideration if you're taking youngsters. The disadvantage is that you'll be fishing over an area that's been fished the day before and the day before that. Worse, if the fishing is poor, it's tough to relocate since few outfitters are keen on constantly switching anglers from one area to another, especially on busy weekends.","director of client services for the Laval Transit Corp, said 20 per cent of the bus routes were cancelled because of icy bridge conditions while buses on the remaining runs were delayed by 45 to 50 minutes Doris Drouin, administrative assistant with the Montreal South Shore Transit Corp, said buses were behind schedule by approximately 45 minutes on most routes yesterday morning She said one of the major problems was that the reserved bus lane on the Champlain Bridge was closed because of ice ""It was a very difficult morning,"" Drouin said Montreal Urban Community Transit Corp buses were five to 12 minutes late on their morning runs and Metro rush hour service was extended by an hour in the morning and again in the afternoon, official Jean-Yves Duthel said Montreal streets were cleared of snow and ice by mid-afternoon, the communications co-ordinator for the city public works department said Susan Ellefsen said the city's snow removal crews were on the ready at 3 a m and went to work at 5 a m when 2.5 cm of snow had fallen ""There was less snow than we had expected,"" she said Lagace, a weather specialist with Environment Canada,","Instead of harassing casual anglers on Montreal-area waters once again to make sure they have valid fishing permits, game wardens ought to visit some of the ice-fishing cabins along the south shore of Lake St. Louis from time to time. Seems the anglers in cabins are racking up an unusual number of big bass and many have spear marks on them. Frog spears are being used extensively. In the semi-darkness of the fishing shack, it's easy enough to spot the bass as they swim by under the ice. It's true that there's no law against having the spears, but spearing bass is both illegal and detrimental to the bass population of the area. If fishing for big bass hits a slump come summer, we'll know where to lay the blame. And speaking of declining fish populations, the quasi-commercial perch fishery on Montreal-area waters continues to mushroom as more and more anglers cash in on the bonanza. A few years ago, there might have been a handful of ice fishermen who sold their catches of perch and other panfish; this winter their numbers have mushroomed to the extent that one in 10 anglers on the ice at any one time are fishing commercially."

Bourque pledges better services AARON DERFEL Gazette Civic Affairs Reporter Mayor Pierre Bourque conceded yesterday that snow removal has suffered under his administration but he blamed the problems on blue-collar workers and bad weather. Still, he pledged to improve snow-clearing and other services should he be re-elected. At the same time, he ruled out the idea of charging for services based on consumption. What I can tell Montrealers is that we will do everything to improve the performance of our workers, he said during a meeting with The Gazette's editorial board. Bourque has come under sharp criticism for cutting funding to essential services like libraries and mass transit while imposing user fees on recreational activities. During the campaign, he has preferred to dwell on his economic-development record, pointing out that he hasn't raised property taxes. Yesterday, however, Bourque addressed the issue of services head-on. He admitted snow removal was weak last winter and in 1997 but he said the problem was beyond his control. He argued that the overtime strike by blue-collar workers in 1997 slowed snow removal.

The blue collars are responsible for half the city's snow-clearing. Then last winter, the big ice storm hit the Montreal region, paralyzing the city for a month. Bourque promised that sidewalks and streets would be cleared quickly this winter. Montreal is more fragile because the elderly population is bigger than in the suburbs. It's important that the sidewalks be cleared as soon as possible, Bourque said he would also focus on improving the service by the traffic department. Stop signs and traffic lights would be put up more quickly in trouble spots under a more decentralized system, he said. Although his administration has been studying whether to charge for services directly, Bourque said it's premature to consider the idea at this stage. Proponents of the pay-as-you-go approach believe that installing water meters, for example, would cut needless consumption. We have to stop wasting city services, he said. Is it by taxing each service? I'm not convinced. The proof must be made.

As developers drew up plans for high-rise apartments through the winter of 1958-59, the unoccupied building suffered extensive damage from wind, ice and snow. Stewarts to the rescue Concerned neighbors, the Stewarts, saved the building from demolition by anonymously purchasing the property and reselling it to the city of Pointe Claire for $1.

It is a remarkable fact that for many years there has not been an average of one new passenger boat built to ply below Montreal. It follows, therefore, that existing boats are not very new. As a matter of fact, fully ninety percent of all the passenger steamers plying from the lakes to the gulf are old. Now, if their boilers can for close inspection, much more so do their hulls. It is a fact which requires no argument that iron or steel, under even favorable circumstances, will become so eaten into by rust as to lose all their strength. Is it unreasonable, therefore, to suppose that the hull of a vessel which has been running for twenty or thirty years may become weakened from this cause as to collapse in a rough sea or upon colliding with some other object, a wharf or another vessel, for example? The ferry, market and passenger boats coming into this port carry a large number of human beings, and it is only right that those human beings be not unnecessarily exposed to danger. To avoid this, all that is required is for the Government to instruct the inspector of hulls to do his duty more than ever."

The thick primeval forests of colonial times, Denevan argues, represent a recovery from the impact of the Indians at their zenith. In attacking what he calls ""the pristine myth,"" Denevan's September 1992 review, published in the Annals of the American Association of Geographers, offers this summary: ""By 1492 Indian activity throughout the Americas had modified forest extent and composition, created and expanded grasslands and rearranged topography through countless artificial earthworks. Agricultural fields were common, as were houses and towns and roads and trails. All of these had local impacts on soil, microclimate, hydrology and wildlife. Even mild impacts and slow changes, Denevan wrote, add up to dramatic long-term effects. While the impact was not as extensive as that of modern people, he wrote, the paradise that Columbus thought he had found was clearly a humanized paradise."""

This galvanized the scientific, political and industrial community as well as the public, and by 1990 over 50 countries had agreed to a total ban on CFCs by the year 2000. Few environmental issues are as clear-cut as the CFC-ozone story. The offending causative agent is pinpointed, the effects on ozone and UV are known while less destructive alternatives are available. Yet there were too many uses for CFCs and it was economically too important to stop their production immediately. Even after they are banned, CFCs will continue to escape into the air for decades. Compared to ozone depletion by CFCs, ecological problems like global warming, toxic pollution or rain forest destruction are far more complex for identifying the cause, effects and solutions.

What specific human health impacts are mentioned in the passage as a result of the thunderstorm in Ottawa?,"A healthy dose of physical activity also reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease, the fatigue experienced by cancer patients undergoing treatment, osteoporosis (weight-bearing exercise, in particular, strengthens bones), Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure. On a psychological level, it relieves depression, stress and anxiety by releasing mood-lifting endorphins.

The authors of this trial conducted a kind of research called a systematic review. In this kind of study researchers work closely with health librarians to scour the world literature and find all of the studies that answer a specific question. What question did they want to answer? The goal of the study was to see what are the health benefits of wearing a pedometer.","This is not a French-English issue but, like the referendum, a people vs government issue LOUIS DUDEK Montreal Pain relief is sensible As a medical student and as a resident, I have seen many patients experience excruciating pain, from childbirth and from a variety of illnesses I must say that I find Michele Champagne's comments about ""(taking) the pain out of childbirth"" (Gazette, July 30) to be illogical She accuses women who seek analgesia for this severe pain of ""not going with the process,"" claiming that childbirth is ""difficult, painful"" and necessary for initiation into motherhood The rationale for her argument lies, presumably, in the widely held assumption that ""natural is better, and that mainstream medicine, with its painkiller and other medication, as well as its technological interventions,"" is ""unnatural"" and therefore impure and unhealthy I find this attitude narrow-minded After all, the pain of cancer is real and natural; an attack of appendicitis is a naturally occurring process and the flesh-eating bacteria is a naturally occurring organism Furthermore, if one extends Ms. Champagne's argument, one supposes then that we physicians should have our patients with kidney stones ""go with the process"" and deny them Demerol Similarly","Soon I was so much better that my friends remarked upon the change. ""I can now eat and digest any kind of food. Had I known of the merits of Mother Seigel's Syrup sooner I should have been spared much misery. You are at liberty to publish this statement and refer anyone to me."" (Signed) H. B. Franklin, 144 Park Road, Aston, Birmingham, October 6th, 1896. It is now conceded that the majority of our prevailing diseases, including consumption (that spectre of every northern fireside) are more or less closely associated with failure of the digestive process otherwise what we familiarly call indigestion or dyspepsia. Now, as the digestion of food is, beyond question, the superlative function performed within the human body, illness in various forms must result from any imperfection in it, as death rapidly follows upon its complete arrest. It would seem a rational conclusion that any hope of finding a preventive of disease must be founded upon our knowledge of how to control the digestion and maintain it in normal health and vigor indefinitely. On no other theory can we expect to see men die of old age only."

During one of my bronchitis bouts - there'd been a few in recent years - I'd almost had to force myself to light up. There was something about the smell. And slowly, very slowly, the realization came: I feel about as bad as I've ever felt in my life. How much worse would it be if I stopped? I tried to fight it off. I despise change - and quitting a 33-year-old habit is not a minor change. I could hardly remember who I'd been before I started smoking. Had I even kissed anyone yet? Certainly, I had never gotten married, had children, held a job, written books - all those things were accompanied in my life by clouds and clouds of smoke. Smoking was me: smoking had made me. How could I change? What would be left? And after 33 years of smoking, what did I have for my pains? Well, pains for one thing, in my chest. A nice nasty cough. A yellow smile.

"How has the delay in decision-making regarding the plans impacted the English community's access to effective health-care plans, given the outdated 1989 plans and the recent changes to Quebec's health-care system?","No action soon on English health care CAMPBELL CLARK Gazette Quebec Bureau QUEBEC - The new access plans for English-language health services will not be approved until late August or early September, a spokesman for Health Minister Jean Rochon said yesterday. Rochon made a presentation on the plans to the provincial cabinet last Wednesday, Rochon's spokesman, Martin Caille said. The cabinet made no decision on the plans, and no cabinet meetings are scheduled until August. That marks another in a series of delays in the process of approving the new plans, which outline how healthcare institutions will provide service in English. Caille would not say what Rochon recommended to the cabinet, or whether he would recommend changes to the plans, which were drawn up by the province's 16 regional health boards and approved by a provincial advisory committee. The plans became controversial when some Parti Quebecois members complained they would require the hiring of too many bilingual employees at French health-care institutions, and that would conflict with the right to work in French. Rochon then agreed to allow the Office de la Langue Francaise to review the plans, sparking an angry reaction from some anglophone groups, who said they feared the government would try to reduce access to English-language services.","No action soon on English health care CAMPBELL CLARK Gazette Quebec Bureau QUEBEC - The new access plans for English-language health services will not be approved until late August or early September, a spokesman for Health Minister Jean Rochon said yesterday.

"What method does Hydro-Quebec rely on to determine if windblown branches have knocked out power lines serving a small percentage of their clients, and how does this impact the time customers wait for repairs?","The minister had said a decision on the plans would be made in June, and then said two weeks ago he expected a decision in the next few weeks. David Birnbaum, executive director of Alliance Quebec, said the delay means the English community is left without effective access plans, since the 1989 plans now in effect were drawn up long before the massive changes to Quebec's health-care system. When lightning strikes, they're ready to repair damage total, blamed on thunderstorms. Levasseur said the amount of time it takes for power to be restored to an area depends on the circumstances of the blackout. Levasseur acknowledged that however sophisticated the utility's damage-control policies become for dealing with lightning, so far there's been no breakthrough in the war against freezing rain, which left some North Shore Hydro customers without electricity for days last winter. He said the utility is working on a system that could monitor the weight of freezing rain forming on power lines, but the technology was not yet in use across the power distribution network. Lightning is a source of energy Hydro-Quebec cannot harness, and it is expected once again to blackout homes across the province this summer, as thunderstorms roll across southern Quebec.","David Birnbaum, executive director of Alliance Quebec, said the delay means the English community is left without effective access plans, since the 1989 plans now in effect were drawn up long before the massive changes to Quebec's health-care system.
